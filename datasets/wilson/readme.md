This directory contains data on the systematic review performed by Appenzeller-Herzog (2019). The three reference files in the `raw` directory were manually converted to `.csv` files using Zotero, to be found in the `zotero_preprocessed` directory. The script in the `datasetsworkflow` directory can convert these three `.csv` files into one file, suitable for ASReview, `output_csv_wilson.csv` .
