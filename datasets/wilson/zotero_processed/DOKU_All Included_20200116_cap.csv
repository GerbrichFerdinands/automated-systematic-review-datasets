Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody courses. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n=91), trientine (n=58), and zinc salts (n=58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found. CONCLUSION: Under long-term d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.","2016-01","2020-02-20 10:16:09","2020-02-20 10:16:09","","125-30","","1","39","","J Inherit Metab Dis","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","26067812","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Chelating Agents/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/im [Immunology]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/im [Immunology]; 0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear); 0 (Chelating Agents); Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Antinuclear/im [Immunology]; Autoimmune Diseases/ci [Chemically Induced]; Autoimmune Diseases/im [Immunology]; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Monitoring/mt [Methods]; Female; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Humans; J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc); Male; Penicillamine/ae [Adverse Effects]; Penicillamine/im [Immunology]; Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Retrospective Studies; SJ76Y07H5F (Trientine); Trientine/ae [Adverse Effects]; Trientine/im [Immunology]; Trientine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Young Adult; Zinc/ae [Adverse Effects]; Zinc/im [Immunology]; Zinc/tu [Therapeutic Use]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to establish the frequency and outcome of early neurological worsening in patients with WD. METHODS: We analyzed 143 symptomatic patients diagnosed with WD between 2005 and 2009. Early neurological deterioration was based on worsening on the Unified Wilson's Disease Score Scale, scored at baseline through 6 months or occurrence of new neurological symptoms. Reversibility of worsening was followed up to 24 months. RESULTS: Early neurological worsening was observed in 11.1% (16/143) and involved only patients with neurological signs at diagnosis. Mean time to worsening from treatment initiation was 2.3 +/- 1.9 months. Neurological deterioration was completely reversible in 53% (8/15) and partially in 13% (2/15) of patients over 9.2 +/- 5.2 months. Patients who experienced early deterioration had significantly more severe baseline neurological deficit, higher prevalence of thalamic (66% vs 29%) and brain stem (73% vs 33%) lesions seen on baseline magnetic resonance imaging, and more often used concomitant dopamine receptor antagonists (46% vs 5%). Disease duration, treatment type (d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), type of neurological manifestations, initial copper metabolism results, and liver function parameters did not differ between evaluated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological worsening at the beginning of anti-copper therapy may occur in over 10% of WD patients. Special attention should be paid to those with severe initial neurological manifestations, advanced brain injury and using dopamine receptor antagonists. Type of anti-copper therapy did not show clear association with early neurological worsening. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The treatment of WD patients with mild liver disease is not clearly defined. To address this issue, we evaluated long-term outcomes of three treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, zinc or both) in patients diagnosed in childhood. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated efficacy, compliance and reasons for treatment discontinuation in 42 WD patients (median age at diagnosis: 6 years; median follow-up: 12 years) with mild liver disease. Treatment duration for each treatment block until a medication change or completion of follow-up was analyzed. Events of change of treatment were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Total discontinuations due to treatment failure or adverse events were more frequent in patients receiving D-penicillamine (45%) or combination (36%) therapy than in patients receiving zinc (12%) (P = .001 and P = .02, respectively). Treatment failure was more frequent on D-penicillamine (28%) and combination therapy (36%) than on zinc (12%); the difference was statistically significant only between zinc and combination therapy (P = .03). First-line zinc monotherapy controlled WD-related liver disease in 13/15 patients (87%); the two subjects that failed on zinc were poor adherent. Zinc was effective in 3/5 (60%) patients that failed on D-penicillamine and combination regimens. All 15 D-penicillamine responders that switched to zinc had good control of liver disease at a median follow-up of 13.1 years. Among 6 D-penicillamine non-responders that switched to zinc, 4 (67%) responded. At follow-up completion, only 5/42 (12%) patients failed. Adverse event-induced discontinuation was significantly more frequent in patients on D-penicillamine than in patients receiving zinc (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Zinc monotherapy is effective in controlling WD-related liver disease both as first-line and as maintenance treatment in patients with mild liver disease diagnosed in childhood.","2014-03-25","2020-02-20 10:16:10","2020-02-20 10:16:10","","41","","","9","","Orphanet J Rare Dis","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","24661374","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Liver Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Zinc/tu [Therapeutic Use]; 0 (Cation Transport Proteins); Adenosine Triphosphatases; Cation Transport Proteins; EC 3-6-1 (Adenosine Triphosphatases); EC 3-6-3-4 (Wilson disease protein); Female; Humans; J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc); Male; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In all, 143 consecutive patients diagnosed with symptomatic WD from January 2005 to December 2009, followed until December 2010, were included. The decision about first-line therapy was made individually after discussion with the patient. Physicians had no clear preference of one drug over the other. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neurological (DPA, 35; ZS, 21) and hepatic (DPA, 36; ZS, 51) presentation of WD. RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, neurological WD patients scheduled for DPA had a similar probability of not remaining on first-line therapy as patients receiving ZS (20% vs. 24% at the end of follow-up), with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2-3.5). In patients with hepatic WD, this probability was significantly higher for DPA (31% vs. 12%; adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9-9.9), especially in the first 6 months. Early worsening occurred only in neurological WD patients, with no differences between both treatment groups (35% vs. 19%; OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.7-10.8). Neurological improvement and decrease of liver enzymes were achieved with similar frequency. Compliance with DPA was better in hepatic (97% vs. 80%) but not in neurological patients (91% vs. 81%). Drug adverse effects were more common on DPA (15% vs. 3%). CONCLUSIONS: DPA and ZS are effective in the majority of WD patients. Neither therapy appears to be clearly superior. Therefore ZS may be considered a reasonable alternative to DPA as a first-line therapy.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical presentation and long-term outcome, and to examine the progression of hepatic histopathology in serial liver biopsies from WD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of 60 patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered and 40 patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups: progressors (patients who presented worsening of at least one unit of fibrosis) and nonprogressors (patients who presented stable or improved fibrosis scores). RESULTS: A total of 33/40 (83%) patients (nonprogressors) showed stable hepatic histology or improvement. Seven of 40 (17%) patients (progressors) showed worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the histological findings and clinical parameters or initial presentation. CONCLUSION: In our study cohort, liver disease was stable or improving in most of the patients, and development of progressive hepatic symptoms while under treatment was a rare event. The development of new symptoms while under treatment or progression of pre-existing symptoms was more often recorded for neurological than for hepatic symptoms.","2013-01","2020-02-20 10:16:10","2020-02-20 10:16:10","","111-7","","1","25","","Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","23011036","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Hepatolenticular Degeneration/pa [Pathology]; *Liver Cirrhosis/pa [Pathology]; *Liver/pa [Pathology]; 0 (Chelating Agents); 7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate); Adolescent; Adult; Biopsy; Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Chi-Square Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Progression; Female; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatolenticular Degeneration/co [Complications]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; Humans; Italy; Liver Cirrhosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; Liver Cirrhosis/et [Etiology]; Liver/de [Drug Effects]; Male; Middle Aged; Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Retrospective Studies; SJ76Y07H5F (Trientine); Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Trientine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Young Adult; Zinc Sulfate/tu [Therapeutic Use]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Type of presentation, treatment used, biochemical and copper homeostasis parameters were elicited. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (n = 10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). The initial treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at diagnosis was d-penicillamine in 90% and Zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Patients who were maintained on d-penicillamine for the whole period had complete biochemical normalization (baseline ALT: 220 IU/l; last follow up 38 IU/l). In contrast, patients in whom d-penicillamine was switched to Zn, irrespective of the cause, did not show a complete biochemical remission (baseline ALT: 100 IU/l vs. 66 IU/l at last follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was found to be effective in most cases regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in those treated with d-penicillamine agents, and required switching to zinc. Therapy with zinc was well tolerated and appeared to have a good efficacy. However, in 33%, a complete normalization of liver enzymes was never reached.","2012-11","2020-02-20 10:16:11","2020-02-20 10:16:11","","907-14","","6","11","","Ann Hepatol","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","23109455","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Copper/bl [Blood]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Zinc/tu [Therapeutic Use]; 0 (Biomarkers); 0 (Chelating Agents); 789U1901C5 (Copper); Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers/bl [Blood]; Chelating Agents/ae [Adverse Effects]; Child; Drug Substitution; Female; Follow-Up Studies; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatolenticular Degeneration/bl [Blood]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis]; Humans; J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc); Male; Middle Aged; Penicillamine/ae [Adverse Effects]; Retrospective Studies; Spain; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Zinc/ae [Adverse Effects]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When treated, the outcome can be excellent, although the long-term survival has yet to be well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with WD and to assess those factors affecting the phenotypic manifestation of WD. METHODS: The presence of mutations to the ATP7B gene, the clinical manifestations, treatments and the long-term outcomes were analysed retrospectively in 117 patients with WD (59 men and 58 women, aged at evaluation 38.5 +/- 11, range 16-63 years). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with a neurological presentation, 51 patients with a hepatic presentation and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed up for an average of 15.1 +/- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most frequent genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with either the hepatic or the neurological presentation (P = 0.099). d-penicillamine or zinc salts (81 and 17% respectively) were used for treatment, and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic patients became asymptomatic, or improved, during the follow-up (82% patients with hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). The long-term survival of patients with WD did not differ from that of the general Czech population (P = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory response in the great majority of adequately treated patients with WD and survival coincides with that of the general population.

METHODS: We report a group of 12 WD patients treated with zinc and/or penicillamine who underwent multiple follow-up liver biopsies. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were gathered and all patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. RESULTS: Time to repeat biopsy ranged from 2 to 12 years. Six patients (non-progressors) showed stable hepatic histology or improvement. In one case, we observed improvement of fibrosis from stage 2 to 0. Six patients (progressors) had worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the histological findings and serum aminotransferases or copper metabolism parameters. The hepatic copper concentration reached normal levels in only two patients: one from the non-progressors and one from the progressors group. The estimated rate of progression of hepatic fibrosis in the entire group was 0 units per year in the time frame between the first and the second liver biopsy (4 years), and 0.25 between the second and the third (3 years). In the progressors group, the rate of progression of liver fibrosis was estimated at 0.11 fibrosis units per year between the first and second biopsy and, 0.6 fibrosis units between the second and third biopsy. CONCLUSION: The inability of clinical tools to detect fibrosis progression in WD suggests that a liver biopsy with hepatic copper quantification every 3 years should be considered.","2010-03-28","2020-02-20 10:16:12","2020-02-20 10:16:12","","1487-94","","12","16","","World J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","20333789","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Copper/me [Metabolism]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Liver Cirrhosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Liver/de [Drug Effects]; *Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Zinc Sulfate/tu [Therapeutic Use]; 0 (Biomarkers); 0 (Chelating Agents); 7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate); 789U1901C5 (Copper); Adolescent; Adult; Alanine Transaminase/bl [Blood]; Aspartate Aminotransferases/bl [Blood]; Biomarkers/bl [Blood]; Biopsy; Child; Copper/ur [Urine]; EC 2-6-1-1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases); EC 2-6-1-2 (Alanine Transaminase); Female; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatolenticular Degeneration/co [Complications]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/me [Metabolism]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/pa [Pathology]; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis/et [Etiology]; Liver Cirrhosis/me [Metabolism]; Liver Cirrhosis/pa [Pathology]; Liver/me [Metabolism]; Liver/pa [Pathology]; Male; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The duration of follow-up for patients alive was 11.1 +/- 8.8 years. RESULTS: After initiation of treatment (d-penicillamine and zinc salts), 79% of patients had a stable or improved course of disease. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, 15 patients still had a relentlessly progressive course. Thirty patients died. The cumulative probability of survival in a 15-year period for the whole group was 76.7 +/- 4.9%. Better prognosis of WD was associated with male sex, younger age at onset, neurologic form of the disease, and treatment continuity. Causes of death were predominantly related to hepatic failure (16 patients), but also suicide (four patients) and cancer (three patients). CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively early diagnosis and treatment of our patients with WD, mortality was still considerably high.","2009-07","2020-02-20 10:16:12","2020-02-20 10:16:12","","852-7","","7","16","","Eur J Neurol","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","19473354","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Hepatolenticular Degeneration/mo [Mortality]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/pp [Physiopathology]; 0 (Chelating Agents); Age of Onset; Cause of Death; Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Cohort Studies; Female; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatolenticular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; Humans; Male; Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Serbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited owing to low disease frequency. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 163 patients with Wilson's disease, examined at the University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, to determine clinical presentation, diagnostic course and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria for non-caeruloplasmin-bound serum copper, serum caeruloplasmin, 24-h urinary copper excretion, liver copper content, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and histological signs of chronic liver damage were reached in 86.6%, 88.2%, 87.1%, 92.7%, 66.3% and 73% of patients, respectively. By analysis of the coding region of ATP7B (except exons 2, 3 and 21), disease-causing mutations were detected in 57% and 29% of patients with Wilson's disease on both chromosomes and on one chromosome, respectively. No mutations were detected in 15% of patients with Wilson's disease. No significant differences were found in clinical parameters or initial presentation between patients grouped according to their mutations. The patients with neurological symptoms were significantly older at the onset of symptoms than patients with hepatitic symptoms (20.2 v 15.5 years of age, p<0.05), and the neurological symptoms were associated with a significantly longer time from onset to diagnosis than hepatic symptoms (44.4 v 14.4 months, p<0.05). After initiating treatment, 76.1% of the patients had a stable or improved course of the disease. Disease progression under treatment was more likely for neuropsychiatric than for hepatic symptoms. Side effects of treatment occurred in 74.4% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Wilson's disease having predominantly neuropsychiatric symptoms manifest symptoms later, have a longer time delay from onset of symptoms until definitive diagnosis and have a poorer outcome than patients with hepatic symptoms.","2007-01","2020-02-20 10:16:12","2020-02-20 10:16:12","","115-20","","1","56","","Gut","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","16709660","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Hepatolenticular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis]; 0 (Cation Transport Proteins); 0 (Chelating Agents); 0 (Trace Elements); 789U1901C5 (Copper); Adenosine Triphosphatases/ge [Genetics]; Adolescent; Adult; Cation Transport Proteins/ge [Genetics]; Ceruloplasmin/an [Analysis]; Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Copper/bl [Blood]; Copper/ur [Urine]; DNA Mutational Analysis/mt [Methods]; EC 1-16-3-1 (Ceruloplasmin); EC 3-6-1 (Adenosine Triphosphatases); EC 3-6-3-4 (Wilson disease protein); Female; Genotype; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatolenticular Degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/ge [Genetics]; Humans; Infant; J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc); Liver/me [Metabolism]; Liver/pa [Pathology]; Male; Middle Aged; Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Phenotype; Retrospective Studies; SJ76Y07H5F (Trientine); Trace Elements/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Treatment Outcome; Trientine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Zinc/tu [Therapeutic Use]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS: Thirty-five patients with Wilson's disease referred to the University of Padova's Department of Gastroenterology for diagnosis or treatment were observed for a mean 15 years. The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urinary, and hepatic copper concentrations), and uptake of the radiostable isotope Cu into the plasma protein pool. Hepatic Cu content was measured by regular follow-up biopsies. Neurologic outcome after therapy was assessed using a newly developed scoring system. RESULTS: Twenty-three (65.7%) patients presented with liver disease; 12 (34.3%) had mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement. All patients had been initially treated with either penicillamine (23) or zinc sulfate (12). The neurologic symptoms became worse or remained stationary in 75% of those treated with penicillamine, whereas zinc treatment improved these symptoms in 90% of treated cases. Both treatments were effective in improving the hepatic symptoms. No differences in hepatic Cu content emerged between follow-up biopsies in either treatment group. Six patients (26%) had to abandon the penicillamine treatment due to side effects. In all, 4 patients underwent liver transplantation, which was successful in 3, with a mean survival after transplantation of 4.6 years; the fourth, who had a severe neurologic impairment, died of central pontine myelinolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillamine and zinc can effectively treat Wilson's disease, though the side effects of penicillamine may be severe enough to prompt its suspension. Liver transplantation remains the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease.","2006-11","2020-02-20 10:16:13","2020-02-20 10:16:13","","936-41","","10","40","","J Clin Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","17063115","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Hepatolenticular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/th [Therapy]; 0 (Biomarkers); 0 (Chelating Agents); 0 (Isotopes); 0 (Trace Elements); 789U1901C5 (Copper); Adolescent; Adult; Alanine Transaminase/bl [Blood]; Alanine Transaminase/de [Drug Effects]; Biomarkers/bl [Blood]; Biomarkers/ur [Urine]; Ceruloplasmin/de [Drug Effects]; Ceruloplasmin/me [Metabolism]; Chelating Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Chelating Agents/ae [Adverse Effects]; Child; Child, Preschool; Copper/ur [Urine]; EC 1-16-3-1 (Ceruloplasmin); EC 2-6-1-2 (Alanine Transaminase); Female; Follow-Up Studies; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatolenticular Degeneration/me [Metabolism]; Humans; Isotopes/ur [Urine]; Italy/ep [Epidemiology]; J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc); Liver Transplantation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Penicillamine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Penicillamine/ae [Adverse Effects]; Postoperative Complications/et [Etiology]; Postoperative Complications/mo [Mortality]; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Trace Elements/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Treatment Outcome; Zinc/tu [Therapeutic Use]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Sixteen patients with hepatic manifestations were diagnosed with WD in the period 1976-2003. We divided this period into two periods, ""past"" and ""recent"". The diagnosis was based on the presence of Kayser-Fleisher rings, low serum copper levels, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge, and increased hepatic copper concentrations. This retrospective study was done at Ehime University Hospital. RESULTS: Four patients, including a pair of siblings, had a family history of WD. Four patients had parental consanguinity. There were 6 patients aged over 40 years in the recent period, whereas no patients in the past period were over 40. Four patients had neurological manifestations. Ten patients had liver cirrhosis and 5 had chronic hepatitis. Two had fatty liver without obesity. All patients in the past period had liver cirrhosis. Three patients with liver cirrhosis were found to have HCC during the follow up. All patients were treated with either D-penicillamine or trientine chloride, or both. However, four patients had to discontinue these agents due to the side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Recently, the number of patients diagnosed with WD has been increasing, not only in terms of those with classical-type WD but also in terms of elderly patients or patients with non-cirrhotic liver injury such as fatty liver and chronic hepatitis. The various clinical features of WD should be recognized and particular attention should focus on HCC as a complication.","2004-12","2020-02-20 10:16:13","2020-02-20 10:16:13","","1165-9","","12","39","","J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","15622480","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/co [Complications]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis]; *Liver Neoplasms/co [Complications]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/ep [Epidemiology]; Child; Female; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/co [Complications]; Humans; Liver Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]; Liver Diseases/et [Etiology]; Liver Neoplasms/ep [Epidemiology]; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AIMS: To report the features of Wilson's disease with severe hepatic insufficiency in a series of 17 patients and, during the second period of the study, to assess the efficacy of a policy consisting of early administration of D-penicillamine. PATIENTS: Seventeen consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. During the first period of the study (up to 1979), none of the patients received D-penicillamine. During the second period (after 1979), all patients without encephalopathy at admission received D-penicillamine. RESULTS: The four patients observed during the first period who did not have encephalopathy at admission and did not receive D-penicillamine progressed to encephalopathy and died. Among the 13 consecutive patients observed during the second period, two patients with encephalopathy at admission did not receive D-penicillamine and were transplanted. The 11 remaining patients all received D-penicillamine. Ten of these patients survived without the need for transplantation and returned to compensated liver disease without liver insufficiency. In one patient, liver insufficiency progressed and transplantation had to be performed. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with Wilson's disease heralded by severe hepatic insufficiency and without encephalopathy at admission, early administration of D-penicillamine was associated with survival without transplantation. These results suggest the importance of early diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease before the onset of encephalopathy, and favour early administration of D-penicillamine which could avoid the need for transplantation in most cases.","2001-06","2020-02-20 10:16:13","2020-02-20 10:16:13","","849-52","","6","48","","Gut","","","","","","","","English","","","MEDLINE","11358907","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","*Chelating Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hepatolenticular Degeneration/th [Therapy]; *Penicillamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; 0 (Chelating Agents); Acute Kidney Injury/et [Etiology]; Acute Kidney Injury/th [Therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine); Hepatic Encephalopathy/et [Etiology]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/co [Complications]; Hepatolenticular Degeneration/di [Diagnosis]; Humans; Liver Transplantation/mt [Methods]; Male; Patient Selection; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large cohorts. We assessed the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and outcomes of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria, and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurologic and hepatic symptoms and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier estimation; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 y after therapy began). RESULTS: Changes in medication were common, resulting in analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were more frequent among those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight months after therapy, hepatic deterioration was reported in only 4 of 333 patients treated initially with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90%, and neurologic improvements were observed in more than 55%, of therapy-naive patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurologic deterioration was observed less frequently in patients given D-penicillamine first (6 of 295) than those given trientine first (4 of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable outcomes, although D-penicillamine had a higher rate of adverse events. Few patients receiving chelation therapy had neurologic deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine. © 2013 AGA Institute.","2013-08","2020-02-20 10:16:14","2020-02-20 10:16:14","","1028-1035","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Embase","369404032","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","albuminuria/si [Side Effect]; alopecia/si [Side Effect]; arthralgia/si [Side Effect]; article; atp7b; chelation therapy; drug efficacy; drug fatality/si [Side Effect]; drug safety; drug withdrawal; elastosis/si [Side Effect]; erythema/si [Side Effect]; fatigue/si [Side Effect]; female; follow up; genotype; headache/si [Side Effect]; hematuria/si [Side Effect]; hirsutism/si [Side Effect]; human; kidney disease/si [Side Effect]; leukopenia/si [Side Effect]; liver function; liver transplantation; lupus erythematosus/si [Side Effect]; major clinical study; male; Metabolic disorder; myalgia/si [Side Effect]; nephrotic syndrome/si [Side Effect]; optic neuritis/si [Side Effect]; patient compliance; penicillamine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; penicillamine/dt [Drug Therapy]; penicillamine/po [Oral Drug Administration]; phenotype; polyneuropathy/si [Side Effect]; pruritus/si [Side Effect]; retrospective study; treatment duration; trientine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; trientine/dt [Drug Therapy]; trientine/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Wilson disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; Wilson's disease; Wilsons disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients are treated with copper chelators and zinc salts, but it is not clear what approach is optimal because there have been few studies of large cohorts. We assessed long-term outcomes of different treatments. Methods: Patients in tertiary care centers were retrospectively analyzed (n = 288; median follow-up time, 17.1 years) for adherence to therapy, survival, treatment failure, and adverse events from different treatment regimens (chelators, zinc, or a combination). Hepatic treatment failure was defined as an increase in activity of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase) >2-fold the upper limit of normal or >100% of baseline with an increase in urinary copper excretion. Results: The median age at onset of Wilson disease was 17.5 years. Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred in 196 (68.1%) and 99 (34.4%) patients, respectively. Hepatic treatment failure occurred more often from zinc therapy (14/88 treatments) than from chelator therapy (4/313 treatments; P < .001). Actuarial survival, without transplantation, showed an advantage for chelating agents (P < .001 vs zinc). Changes in treatment resulted mostly from adverse events, but the frequency did not differ between groups. Patients who did not respond to zinc therapy showed hepatic improvement after reintroduction of a chelating agent. Conclusions: Treatments with chelating agents or zinc salt are effective in most patients with Wilson disease; chelating agents are better at preventing hepatic deterioration. It is important to identify patients who do not respond to zinc therapy and have increased activities of liver enzymes, indicating that a chelating agent should be added to the therapeutic regimen. © 2011 AGA Institute.","2011-04","2020-02-20 10:16:14","2020-02-20 10:16:14","","1189-1198","","4","140","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Embase","361522393","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alanine aminotransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; aspartate aminotransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; atp7b; chelation therapy; cohort analysis; copper; d-penicillamine; deterioration; drug efficacy; drug treatment failure; drug withdrawal; enzyme activity; female; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gamma glutamyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; human; liver failure/co [Complication]; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; neurologic disease/co [Complication]; patient compliance; penicillamine/cb [Drug Combination]; penicillamine/dt [Drug Therapy]; priority journal; retrospective study; side effect/si [Side Effect]; survival; treatment outcome; Trientine; trientine/cb [Drug Combination]; trientine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Triethylenetetramine; Wilson disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; zinc/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; zinc/cb [Drug Combination]; zinc/dt [Drug Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Penicillamine, used for years on most patients, causes neurologic worsening in up to half of such patients, and half of those who worsen never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We have developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for this type of patient, and it has worked well in open label studies. Trientine, another anticopper drug on the market approved for penicillamine intolerant patients, had not been tried in this type of patient. Here, we report on a double blind trial of TM versus trientine in the neurologically presenting Wilson's disease patient. Design and Methods: The study was a double blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc, or trientine plus zinc, for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they presented with neurologic symptoms from Wilson's disease, if they had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed in the hospital for the 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations, to evaluate possible neurologic worsening. They also had blood and urine studies done weekly. At discharge from hospital they were continued on zinc maintenance therapy, and returned at yearly intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients were entered into the trientine arm and 6 reached criteria for neurologic deterioration, while 25 patients were entered into the TM arm and only 1 deteriorated (p < 0.05). One patient on trientine had an adverse event while 7 on TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurologic and speech recovery over 3 years was good. Interpretation: TM is a superior choice to trientine for the initial therapy of neurologic Wilson's disease. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.","2008-03","2020-02-20 10:16:15","2020-02-20 10:16:15","","153-165","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Embase","351266908","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","alanine aminotransferase blood level; anemia/si [Side Effect]; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; copper blood level; Copper toxicity; disease exacerbation; double blind procedure; Double blind trial; drug choice; drug safety; drug tolerability; fatality; follow up; hospital patient; human; laboratory test; leukopenia/si [Side Effect]; maintenance therapy; Neurologic damage; neurologic examination; penicillamine/dt [Drug Therapy]; priority journal; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; side effect/si [Side Effect]; speech and language assessment; Tetrathiomolybdate; tetrathiomolybdic acid/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; tetrathiomolybdic acid/cb [Drug Combination]; tetrathiomolybdic acid/cm [Drug Comparison]; tetrathiomolybdic acid/ct [Clinical Trial]; tetrathiomolybdic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; Trientine; trientine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; trientine/cb [Drug Combination]; trientine/cm [Drug Comparison]; trientine/ct [Clinical Trial]; trientine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Wilson disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; Wilson's disease; zinc/cb [Drug Combination]; zinc/ct [Clinical Trial]; zinc/dt [Drug Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients either received 500 mg of trientine hydrochloride 2 times per day or 20 mg of tetrathiomolybdate 3 times per day with meals and 20 mg 3 times per day between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received 50 mg of zinc 2 times per day. Patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with neurologic and speech function assessed weekly; discharged taking 50 mg of zinc 3 times per day, and returned annually for follow-up. Setting: A university hospital referral setting. Patients: Primarily newly diagnosed patients with Wilson disease presenting with neurologic symptoms who had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with an anticopper drug. Intervention: Treatment with either trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. Main Outcome Measures: Neurologic function was assessed by semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations. Drug adverse events were evaluated by blood cell counts and biochemical measures. Results: Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm underwent neurologic deterioration (P<.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had adverse effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had further transaminase elevations. One patient receiving trientine had an adverse effect of anemia. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration. Neurologic and speech recovery during a 3-year follow-up period were quite good. Conclusion: Tetrathiomolybdate is a better choice than trientine for preserving neurologic function in patients who present with neurologic disease. ©2006 American Medical Association.

The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate transaminase levels after penicillamine and zinc treatment in children with Wilson's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and nine patients with Wilson's disease (median age at diagnosis, 7.2 years; range, 1 to 18 years), treated for at least 12 months and observed in the last 20 years at 11 Paediatric Departments were studied. Clinical, laboratory and histologic features at diagnosis and initial treatment were recorded. Efficacy parameters were normalization of serum transaminase level and improved clinical and/or laboratory signs. One hundred and two patients had clinical or laboratory signs of liver disease. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 87 patients (64%) given penicillamine normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels within a median of 17 months (range, 2 to 96 months). Of the 29 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, 17 (59%) switched to zinc; only four of these normalized ALT on zinc within a median period of 38 months (range, 7 to 48 months). Eleven (50%) of the 22 patients given zinc alone normalized ALT within a median period of 6 months (range, 1 to 36 months). Of the 11 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, five switched to penicillamine. Three of the five normalized ALT within a median period of 6 months (range, 6 to 9 months). Overall, in penicillamine-treated and zinc-treated patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia, ALT decreased from a basal median of 236 IU/L (range, 54 to 640 IU/L) to a median of 78 (range, 46 to 960 IU/L) at the end of follow-up (P = 0.0245). Poor compliance was suspected in only 10% of cases. No predictive factor of persistent hypertransaminasemia was identified. Liver disease did not worsen in any patient during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Although the efficacy of penicillamine and zinc is well documented, it is notable that a subset of children with Wilson's disease-related liver disease (36%) had hypertransaminasemia despite appropriate treatment with penicillamine or zinc.","2004-10","2020-02-20 10:16:15","2020-02-20 10:16:15","","331-336","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Embase","39721855","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","adolescent; alanine aminotransferase; article; blood; child; comparative study; enzymology; female; human; infant; liver; male; pathology; penicillamine/dt [Drug Therapy]; preschool child; retrospective study; Wilson disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; zinc/dt [Drug Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we describe the adult cases of hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease diagnosed at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the University Hospital Lausanne, Switzerland between September 2004 and August 2016. METHOD(S): Clinical manifestations, results of diagnostic tests, management and outcomes of adult patients with hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease were assessed based on standardised medical records. In addition, liver histology was reviewed and the lesional patterns were recorded. RESULT(S): Ten new adult cases of hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease were diagnosed in our centre between September 2004 and August 2016. Male to female ratio was 1:1 and median age at diagnosis was 26 (range 18&ndash;56) years. Four patients presented with acute liver failure, four with persistently elevated liver function tests, and two with decompensated cirrhosis; none had neurological manifestations. Only one patient had a Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring. Median ceruloplasmin level at diagnosis was 0.13 (range <0.03&ndash;0.30) g/l, median 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 2.8 (range 0.3&ndash;77.3) &mu;mol, and median hepatic copper concentration was 789 (range 284&ndash;1677) &mu;g/g. At least one mutation in the ATP7B gene was identified in eight patients. Allelic frequency of the common H1069Q mutation was 19%. Leipzig score was &ge;5 in all patients. Three patients presenting with acute liver failure and the two with decompensated cirrhosis underwent successful liver transplantation. One patient with acute liver failure recovered under chelation therapy, as predicted by a Dhawan score <11. D-penicillamine was used as first-line chelator treatment, with a subsequent switch to trientine due to adverse effects in three out of six patients. CONCLUSION(S): The clinical presentation of hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease is highly variable. Three out of 10 patients were diagnosed at an age >35 years. A high index of suspicion in clinically compatible situations is key.","2018-12-17","2020-02-20 10:16:15","2020-02-20 10:16:15","","w14699","","","148","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Embase","625631011","Ovid Technologies","","","","","","acute liver failure; adult; adverse drug reaction; article; case report; ceruloplasmin; chelation therapy; clinical article; decompensated liver cirrhosis; diagnosis; endogenous compound; excretion; female; gastroenterology; gene expression; gene frequency; gene mutation; histopathology; human; liver function test; liver histology; liver transplantation; male; medical record; penicillamine; protein expression; side effect; Switzerland; tertiary care center; trientine; university hospital; Wilson disease; Wilson disease protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson disease based on the data generated from this study. Methods: We utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records of nearly 99% of Taiwan's residents. The database used is a random sample of two-million out of 23-million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two-million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in either outpatient clinic or inpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was mostly established at 20-24 and 10-14 years of age, followed by 25-29 years. Fifty four of all subjects (81.8%) started the treatment with D-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. Conclusion: D-penicillamine is still the most popular prescription of Wilson disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a favorable potential outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study.
