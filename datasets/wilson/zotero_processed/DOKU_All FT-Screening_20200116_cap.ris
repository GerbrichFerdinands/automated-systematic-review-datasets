AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of patients ages <=5 years with early onset Wilson disease (WD).
METHODS: Data from 143 pediatric patients with WD treated at our center between January 1996 and November 2015 were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: A review of the 143 pediatric patients with WD identified 21 (10 girls, 11 boys) with first symptoms or abnormal liver function test results at age <=5 years. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed in 8 patients younger than 5 years. At baseline the mean serum alanine aminotransferase level was 222 U/L and the mean serum aspartate aminotransferase level was 130 U/L. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration in 16 tested patients was <20 mg/dL. Of the 15 patients who underwent urinary copper excretion testing, 8 had levels between 40 and 100 mug/day, with only 4 having levels >100 mug/day. Liver copper quantification was >250 mug/g dry weight in 16 patients. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q, with compound heterozygosity in 5 patients and homozygosity in 9. Sixteen patients were treated with zinc salts and 5 with D-penicillamine. Both treatments were effective, with no serious side effects observed after 3 to 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: WD can present as early as 2 years of age. Because biochemical tests may be less sensitive in very young children, diagnoses may require a combination of tests. If molecular tests are inconclusive, liver copper content should be measured.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism causing dysfunctions of various organs, mostly the liver and brain. If untreated, WD is fatal, but early treatment results in a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome has not yet been clarified. To address this issue, we evaluated the neurological status of early-treated WD patients without overt nervous system impairment using neurophysiological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging procedures at least 10 years after treatment onset.
METHODS: Thirty-eight WD patients (18 females, aged 24.47 +/- 7.50 years), who received an early diagnosis (in presymptomatic or mild/moderate liver disease stages without neurological involvement) and prompt treatment, were clinically evaluated with the Global Assessment Scale. Presentation was hepatic in 36 subjects (95%), while 2 patients (5%) were presymptomatic. A neurophysiological study was performed to explore the central motor conduction time of the upper and lower limbs, and motor cortex excitability using single pulses and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Neuroimages were obtained with brain magnetic resonance scans. Cognitive abilities, and psychiatric and behavioral disturbances were evaluated with neuropsychological tests.
RESULTS: Patients were undergoing treatment with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good adherence. They did not present any neurological signs at clinical evaluation or at specific scale of impairment, the mean Global Assessment Scale score was 0.3 +/- 0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric assessment ruled out subclinical involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of WD may prevent the onset of neurologic damage, even at subclinical level.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic Wilson disease patients. Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody courses.
RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n=91), trientine (n=58), and zinc salts (n=58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found.
CONCLUSION: Under long-term d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Zinc therapy is considered a good option in Wilson disease (WD), as a first-line treatment in presymptomatic children and a maintenance therapy after the initial chelator therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the practical use of zinc treatment in French pediatric centers.
METHODS: A national survey was conducted in the 6 French centers using zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological parameters, dosage, and outcome were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 26 children were reported to be treated with zinc acetate, alone or in association with chelators. Of the 9 children (35%) who received zinc alone as a first-line therapy, 2 were switched to D-penicillamine because of inefficacy and 7 remained on zinc alone, but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19%) were initially treated with zinc in association with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or Trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Among the 12 children (46%) who received zinc as a maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, no relapse of hepatic cytolysis occurred during a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but 2 of them were switched to Trientine because of zinc-related adverse effects. Epigastric pain was observed in 4 children, and a gastric perforation occurred in 1 child.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates poor efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy to control liver disease in half presymptomatic children and a high incidence of related gastrointestinal adverse effects in children with WD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early neurological worsening during treatment initiation for Wilson's disease (WD) is an unresolved problem. Our aim was to establish the frequency and outcome of early neurological worsening in patients with WD.
METHODS: We analyzed 143 symptomatic patients diagnosed with WD between 2005 and 2009. Early neurological deterioration was based on worsening on the Unified Wilson's Disease Score Scale, scored at baseline through 6 months or occurrence of new neurological symptoms. Reversibility of worsening was followed up to 24 months.
RESULTS: Early neurological worsening was observed in 11.1% (16/143) and involved only patients with neurological signs at diagnosis. Mean time to worsening from treatment initiation was 2.3 +/- 1.9 months. Neurological deterioration was completely reversible in 53% (8/15) and partially in 13% (2/15) of patients over 9.2 +/- 5.2 months. Patients who experienced early deterioration had significantly more severe baseline neurological deficit, higher prevalence of thalamic (66% vs 29%) and brain stem (73% vs 33%) lesions seen on baseline magnetic resonance imaging, and more often used concomitant dopamine receptor antagonists (46% vs 5%). Disease duration, treatment type (d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), type of neurological manifestations, initial copper metabolism results, and liver function parameters did not differ between evaluated groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurological worsening at the beginning of anti-copper therapy may occur in over 10% of WD patients. Special attention should be paid to those with severe initial neurological manifestations, advanced brain injury and using dopamine receptor antagonists. Type of anti-copper therapy did not show clear association with early neurological worsening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) evolves rapidly and is fatal if untreated. The treatment of WD patients with mild liver disease is not clearly defined. To address this issue, we evaluated long-term outcomes of three treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, zinc or both) in patients diagnosed in childhood.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated efficacy, compliance and reasons for treatment discontinuation in 42 WD patients (median age at diagnosis: 6 years; median follow-up: 12 years) with mild liver disease. Treatment duration for each treatment block until a medication change or completion of follow-up was analyzed. Events of change of treatment were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Total discontinuations due to treatment failure or adverse events were more frequent in patients receiving D-penicillamine (45%) or combination (36%) therapy than in patients receiving zinc (12%) (P = .001 and P = .02, respectively). Treatment failure was more frequent on D-penicillamine (28%) and combination therapy (36%) than on zinc (12%); the difference was statistically significant only between zinc and combination therapy (P = .03). First-line zinc monotherapy controlled WD-related liver disease in 13/15 patients (87%); the two subjects that failed on zinc were poor adherent. Zinc was effective in 3/5 (60%) patients that failed on D-penicillamine and combination regimens. All 15 D-penicillamine responders that switched to zinc had good control of liver disease at a median follow-up of 13.1 years. Among 6 D-penicillamine non-responders that switched to zinc, 4 (67%) responded. At follow-up completion, only 5/42 (12%) patients failed. Adverse event-induced discontinuation was significantly more frequent in patients on D-penicillamine than in patients receiving zinc (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Zinc monotherapy is effective in controlling WD-related liver disease both as first-line and as maintenance treatment in patients with mild liver disease diagnosed in childhood.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease (WD) receiving either D-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as first-line therapy.
METHODS: In all, 143 consecutive patients diagnosed with symptomatic WD from January 2005 to December 2009, followed until December 2010, were included. The decision about first-line therapy was made individually after discussion with the patient. Physicians had no clear preference of one drug over the other. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neurological (DPA, 35; ZS, 21) and hepatic (DPA, 36; ZS, 51) presentation of WD.
RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, neurological WD patients scheduled for DPA had a similar probability of not remaining on first-line therapy as patients receiving ZS (20% vs. 24% at the end of follow-up), with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2-3.5). In patients with hepatic WD, this probability was significantly higher for DPA (31% vs. 12%; adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9-9.9), especially in the first 6 months. Early worsening occurred only in neurological WD patients, with no differences between both treatment groups (35% vs. 19%; OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.7-10.8). Neurological improvement and decrease of liver enzymes were achieved with similar frequency. Compliance with DPA was better in hepatic (97% vs. 80%) but not in neurological patients (91% vs. 81%). Drug adverse effects were more common on DPA (15% vs. 3%).
CONCLUSIONS: DPA and ZS are effective in the majority of WD patients. Neither therapy appears to be clearly superior. Therefore ZS may be considered a reasonable alternative to DPA as a first-line therapy.

AB  - Copper accumulation in tissues due to a biallelic pathogenic mutation of the gene: ATP7B results in a clinical phenotype known as Wilson disease (WD). Aberrations in copper homeostasis can create favourable conditions for superoxide-yielding redox cycling and oxidative tissue damage. Drugs used in WD treatment aim to remove accumulated copper and normalise the free copper concentration in the blood. In the current study the effect of decoppering treatment on copper metabolism and systemic antioxidant capacity parameters was analyzed. Treatment naive WD patients (TNWD) (n = 33), those treated with anti-copper drugs (TWD) (n = 99), and healthy controls (n = 99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients characterised with decreased copper metabolism parameters, as well as decreased total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) level, activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and S-transferase glutathione, compared to controls. TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolism parameters, higher total AOP and higher levels of GSH than TWD individuals; however, no difference was observed between these two patient groups with respect to the rest of the antioxidant capacity parameters. Patients who had undergone treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc sulphate did not differ with respect to copper metabolism or antioxidant capacity parameters, with the exception of GPx that was lower in D-penicillamine treated individuals. These data suggest that anti-copper treatment affects copper metabolism as well as improves, but does not normalize, natural antioxidant capacity in patients with WD. We propose to undertake studies aimed to evaluate the usefulness of antioxidants as well as selenium as a supplemental therapy in WD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillamine is a standard therapy for Wilson disease (WD) but some patients have paradoxical worsening. Predictors of such deterioration have not been evaluated. This study documents frequency and predictors of deterioration following treatment in WD.
METHODS: 59 consecutive patients with neurologic WD and 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Their clinical, laboratory, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI findings with and without worsening were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months or earlier if needed. Deterioration was defined by >10% worsening in baseline Burke-Fahn-Marsden score or appearance of new neurological sign.
RESULTS: Patients' median age was 13 years and 13 were females. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened following treatment; 10 within 1 month, 7 in 1-3 months, and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Deterioration was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and evidence of chronic liver disease. None of the asymptomatic patients following zinc therapy deteriorated.
CONCLUSIONS: In the deteriorating group, withdrawal of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 improved by trientine therapy and 4 continued to deteriorate till 3 months. 30.2% patients with WD deteriorated following penicillamine, especially those with chronic liver disease, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited copper metabolism disorder that leads to dysfunction of affected tissues, mostly in the liver and brain. Anti-copper treatment should prevent clinically overt WD in pre-symptomatic patients but this has not been supported by strong evidence. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment in clinically pre-symptomatic patients, with particular emphasis on patient compliance with treatment.
METHODS: Data were analyzed for 87 consecutive patients with no clinical symptoms of WD who were identified between 1957 and 2009 by family screening. All of them since diagnosis were treated with either zinc sulphate (Zn) (66.7%) or D-penicillamine (DPA) (33.3%).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 years (range 3-52), 55 (63%) patients remained without clinical symptoms, 13 (15%) developed neuropsychiatric symptoms and 21 (24%) developed hepatic dysfunction, including five deaths from hepatic failure. Non-compliance for at least three consecutive months was observed in 39 patients, and in 29 cases this extended for more than 12 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the odds of developing symptomatic WD were independently increased by non-compliance (odds ratio 24.0, 95% confidence interval 6.0-99.0). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis patients who were compliant to treatment had a significantly higher likelihood of remaining symptom-free, and their overall survival was similar to the survival rate observed in the general population.
CONCLUSION: The use of anti-copper agents in clinically pre-symptomatic patients diagnosed with WD allows clinically overt disease to be effectively prevented. However, compliance with therapy is extremely important.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of chelation treatment with penicillamine (PCA) in cross combination with sodium 2, 3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS) repeatedly in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Thirty-five patients with WD were enrolled. They were administrated intravenous DMPS in cross combination with oral PCA alternately which was practiced repeatedly, all with Zinc in the meantime. During the treatment, clinical observations and 24-h urine copper excretion as well as adverse effects of medicines were recorded and analyzed. Although the incidence of adverse effects was not significantly different after either intravenous DMPS or oral PCA treatment, levels of 24-h urine copper tended to be higher after short-term intravenous DMPS than that of oral PCA. Adverse effects in the course of intravenous DMPS were mainly neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reaction and bleeding tendency. As compared with oral PCA alone or intravenous DMPS alone, such repeated cross combination treatment could as much as possible avoid continued drug adverse effects or poor curative effect and had less chance to stop treatment in WD patients. Improved or recovered liver function in 71% of the patients, alleviated neurologic symptoms in 50% of the patients, and disappeared hematuria in 70% of the patients could be observed during the follow-up period of 6 months to 5 years after such combined chelation regimen. Chelation treatment repeatedly with oral penicillamine in cross combination with intravenous DMPS alternately could be more beneficial for WD patients to relieve symptoms, avoid continued drug adverse effects and maintain lifelong therapy.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the side effects of a zinc sulphate therapy in a cohort of Polish pediatric patients with Wilson's disease.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 53 pediatric patients with Wilson's disease treated at the Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland between the years 1996 and 2011 with zinc sulphate. Patients were diagnosed with Wilson's disease according to the scoring system of Ferenci, with 49 cases confirmed by mutation analysis. Data about the dosage scheme of zinc sulphate, side effects and efficacy and toxicity of the treatment were collected and recorded in the patient's medical chart at each visit to the hospital.
RESULTS: Mean age of diagnosis for the entire cohort was 10 years (range, 2.5-17 years). Duration of treatment with zinc sulfate was 83.3 wk (range, 8-344 wk). Side effects, all of gastrointestinal origin, were observed in 21 patients (40%--9 males and 12 females), irrespective of the duration of therapy. Thirteen out of 21 patients were over the age of 10 years. The most common ATP7B mutation was p.H1069Q. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, performed in 7 patients (33.3%) suffering from persistent and severe abdominal pain, revealed gastrointestinal ulcerations or erosions with negative Helicobacter pylori tests in all subjects investigated. The above mentioned 7 patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors. Three of those experienced resolution of symptoms, whereas proton-pump inhibitors failed to alleviate symptoms of the remaining four children and conversion of therapy to D-penicillamine was needed.
CONCLUSION: Zinc sulphate appears to cause significant gastrointestinal side effects, which children on therapy for Wilson's disease should be closely monitored for.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inborn disease related to copper storage, leading to liver cirrhosis and neuropsychological deterioration. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical presentation and long-term outcome, and to examine the progression of hepatic histopathology in serial liver biopsies from WD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of 60 patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered and 40 patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups: progressors (patients who presented worsening of at least one unit of fibrosis) and nonprogressors (patients who presented stable or improved fibrosis scores).
RESULTS: A total of 33/40 (83%) patients (nonprogressors) showed stable hepatic histology or improvement. Seven of 40 (17%) patients (progressors) showed worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the histological findings and clinical parameters or initial presentation.
CONCLUSION: In our study cohort, liver disease was stable or improving in most of the patients, and development of progressive hepatic symptoms while under treatment was a rare event. The development of new symptoms while under treatment or progression of pre-existing symptoms was more often recorded for neurological than for hepatic symptoms.

AB  - We studied the cause of death in a consecutive series of 164 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) diagnosed over an 11 year period. A total of 20 [12% (95% CI 10.3-16.0)] died during the observation period. The relative survival rate of all patients in our group was statistically smaller than in Polish population. The main cause of death was the diagnosis in advanced stage of disease, but in six patients presenting with mild signs, we observed the progression of the disease despite treatment. There was no difference in mortality rate in patients treated with d-penicillamine or zinc sulphate as initial therapy. The prognosis for survival in the majority of WD patients is favourable, provided that therapy is introduced early.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on Wilson's disease (WD) show lack of correlations between neurological and neuroimaging features. Long-term follow-up reports with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different modalities of treatment are scarce.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent pretreatment and posttreatment brain MRI scans to evaluate the range of abnormalities and the evolution along these different periods. All patients underwent at least two MRI scans at different intervals, up to 11 years after the beginning of treatment. MRI findings were correlated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and treatment with two different drugs. Patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: D: -penicillamine (D-P), zinc (Zn), and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to D-P.
RESULTS: MRI scans before treatment showed, in all patients, hypersignal intensity lesions on T2- and proton-density-weighted images bilaterally and symmetrically at basal nuclei, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum, brain cortex, and brain white matter. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disturbances, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea, and athetosis.
CONCLUSIONS: From the neurological point of view, there was no difference on the evolution between the group treated exclusively with D-P and the one treated with Zn. Analysis of MRI scans with longer intervals after the beginning of treatment depicted a trend for neuroimaging worsening, without neurological correspondence, among patients treated with Zn. Neuroimaging pattern of evolution was more favorable for the group that received exclusively D-P.

TI  - Practical recommendations and new therapies for Wilson's disease
AU  - Brewer, G. J.
T2  - Drugs
AB  - Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation. The basic defect is a failure of excretion of excess copper in the bile by the liver for loss in the stool. The accumulating copper causes damage primarily to the liver and the brain. Patients typically present in the second to the fourth decades of life with liver disease, a neurological disease of the movement disorder type, or a wide array of behavioural disturbances. Because the manifestations of Wilson's disease are so protean, and the disease masquerades so well as something else, recognition of the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major problem, leading to serious underdiagnosis of the disease. Excellent therapies exist for both the prophylaxis and treatment of Wilson's disease. The longer recognition and diagnosis are delayed, the greater the risk of permanent damage to liver and/or brain. The availability of effective therapy and the risks in delay or therapy make the earliest possible diagnosis critical. Once the disease comes under consideration, a series of diagnostic steps can be undertaken which almost always establish or rule out the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. These include urine copper, blood ceruloplasmin, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and liver biopsy with quantitative copper assay. Currently, there are 4 drugs being used as anticopper agents in Wilson's disease. These are zinc, which blocks intestinal absorption of copper, penicillamine and trientine, both of which are chelators that increase urinary excretion of copper, and tetrathiomolybdate which forms a tripartite complex with copper and protein, and can block copper absorption from the intestine, or render blood copper non-toxic. Zinc is clearly the treatment of choice, in our opinion, for maintenance therapy, for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient from the beginning and for the treatment of the pregnant patient, because of its complete efficacy and lack of toxicity. For the initial treatment of the patient presenting with mild liver failure, we empirically use a combination of trientine and zinc. Trientine gives a strong, fast, negative copper balance, and zinc induces hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters hepatic copper. For the initial treatment of patients presenting with neurological disease we use an experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, which provides rapid, safe control of copper. These latter patients are at great risk of serious permanent neurological worsening with penicillamine, and zinc is too slow-acting, in our judgment, to be optimal. [References: 46]

T2  - Journal of Neurology
AB  - The results of treatment with D-penicillamine (D-P) or zinc sulphate (Zn) in 67 newly diagnosed cases of Wilson's disease have been compared. All patients (7 with hepatic, 1 with psychiatric and 59 with neurological or preclinical forms) were fully compliant. During 12 years of observation, 34 patients received d-P and 33 Zn as the primary treatment. Fifteen patients (44%) discontinued D-P, in 10 cases owing to side effects. Four (12%) patients discontinued Zn, in 2 cases because of side-effects. One patient who received Zn deteriorated during the first few months after the initiation of therapy. The effectiveness of long-term treatment with D-P and Zn was similar in those patients who were able to continue the initial therapy. Zn was tolerated better than D-P; we suggest, therefore, that it may be recommended as an initial therapy for patients in the preclinical stage of Wilson's disease or with neurological presentation of the disease. More observation is needed for patients with the hepatic and psychiatric forms of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Our objective was to describe the diverse patterns, therapies, and outcomes of this disease.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study over two decades on WD patients in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were retrieved from their charts, referral notes and our hospital electronic records and were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation was 16.8 (10.7) years and 56.5% were males. The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological, and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%), and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) were asymptomatic cases detected by family screening. A family history of WD was positive in 41 (57.7%) patients, and consanguinity of parents was found in 26 (36.6%) patients. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 92.2 (72.9) (range, 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow up, while 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%) were still on or lost from follow-up, respectively. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 (12) (range, 4-62) years. Hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7.0%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58 (81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientine were given to 32 (45.1%) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation and one died (1.4%) on the waiting list. The liver condition remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%), and the neurological status showed improvement in 11 (34.4%) of the 32 patients who had neurological involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the biggest cohort to be reported from the Middle East. WD presentation and outcome of WD are very diverse, and its diagnosis still depends on clinical, laboratory, and radiological evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. WD should be considered in patients of any age with obscure hepatic and/or neurological abnormalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are certain areas of uncertainty regarding the best therapeutic approach in patients diagnosed with Wilson Disease (WD). Our aim was to assess treatment response to different therapies in a cohort of WD patients followed in a single center.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study in which clinical, laboratory and imaging data are reviewed in a series of 20 WD patients with a median follow-up of 14 years. Type of presentation, treatment used, biochemical and copper homeostasis parameters were elicited.
RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (n = 10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). The initial treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at diagnosis was d-penicillamine in 90% and Zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Patients who were maintained on d-penicillamine for the whole period had complete biochemical normalization (baseline ALT: 220 IU/l; last follow up 38 IU/l). In contrast, patients in whom d-penicillamine was switched to Zn, irrespective of the cause, did not show a complete biochemical remission (baseline ALT: 100 IU/l vs. 66 IU/l at last follow-up).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was found to be effective in most cases regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in those treated with d-penicillamine agents, and required switching to zinc. Therapy with zinc was well tolerated and appeared to have a good efficacy. However, in 33%, a complete normalization of liver enzymes was never reached.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical-laboratory and evolutionary analysis of twenty-eight patients with Wilson's disease.
METHODS: Twenty-eight children (twelve females and sixteen males) with Wilson's disease were evaluated retrospectively between 1987 and 2009, with a follow-up of 72 months (1 - 240 months). The clinical, laboratory, and histologic features at diagnosis were recorded at the end of the study.
RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (2 - 18 years). Twelve patients were asymptomatic, seven had hepatitis symptoms, five had raised aminotransferase levels, three had hepatomegaly associated with neurological disorders, one had fulminant hepatitis with hemolytic anemia, and six patients presented with a Kayser-Fleischer ring. A histological analysis revealed that six children had chronic hepatitis, seven had cirrhosis, two had steatosis, one had portal fibrosis, and one had massive necrosis. The treatment consisted of D-penicillamine associated with pyridoxine for 26 patients. Adverse effects were observed in the other two patients: one presented with uncontrollable vomiting and the other demonstrated elastosis perforans serpiginosa. At the end of the study, all 26 treated patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-four of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and pyridoxine, and two were treated with trientine and zinc sulfate. A liver transplant was performed in one patient with fulminant hepatitis, but the final patient died 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit.
CONCLUSIONS: Family screenings associated with early treatment are important in preventing Wilson's disease symptoms and potentially fatal disease progression. The study suggests that Wilson's disease must be ruled out in children older than two years presenting with abnormal levels of hepatic enzymes because of the heterogeneity of symptoms and the encouraging treatment results obtained so far.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Most paediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) present with hepatic manifestations, but some may have neurologic or psychiatric features. Our aim was to define the clinical, biochemical features and the outcome of therapy of a group of Egyptian children diagnosed with WD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out at the Paediatric Hepatology Unit at Cairo University Children's Hospital, Egypt; 54 patients were diagnosed with WD from 1996 to 2009. The diagnosis was based on low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge and/or the presence of Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings.
RESULTS: The clinical presentation was as follows: hepatic presentation in 33 patients (61%), hepato-neurologic 3 (5.5%), neurologic 5 (9.3%) and presymptomatic 13 (24%). Twelve couples had more than one affected sib. Increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge was found in all patients, low serum ceruloplasmin in 97% and K-F rings in 31.5%. All patients were treated with penicillamine and zinc sulphate except one presymptomatic case who was treated with zinc sulphate only. Three patients underwent liver transplantation and eight patients died after a median duration of treatment of 6 months (1-36). The hepatic symptoms improved with treatment but the neurological symptoms remained stationary.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and biochemical assays remain the standard for diagnosis of WD. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat WD with hepatic symptoms. Liver transplantation remains life saving for those with fulminant and end stage WD. Screening for presymptomatic sibs is of utmost importance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Egypt, Wilson disease seems to be under diagnosed and clinical data on large cohorts are limited. The aim of this study is to highlight the clinical, laboratory and genetic characteristics of this disease in our pediatric population as well as to report our experience with both treatment options and outcome.
METHODS: The study included 77 patients from 50 unrelated families (62 were followed up for a mean period of 58.9 +/- 6.4 months and 27 were asymptomatic siblings). Data were collected retrospectively by record analysis and patient interviews. Diagnosis was confirmed by sequencing of the ATP7B gene in 64 patients.
RESULTS: Our patients had unique characteristics compared to other populations. They had a younger age of onset (median: 10 years), higher prevalence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (97.6% in the symptomatic patients), low ceruloplasmin (93.5%), high rate of parental consanguinity (78.9%) as well as a more severe course. 71.42% of those on long term D-penicillamine improved or were stable during the follow up with severe side effects occurring in only 11.5%. Preemptive treatment with zinc monotherapy was an effective non-toxic alternative to D-penicillamine. Homozygous mutations were found in 85.7%, yet limited by the large number of mutations detected, it was difficult to find genotype-phenotype correlations. Missense mutations were the most common while protein-truncating mutations resulted in a more severe course with higher incidence of acute liver failure and neurological symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Egyptian children with Wilson disease present with early Kayser-Fleischer rings and early onset of liver and neurological disease. The mutational spectrum identified differs from that observed in other countries. The high rate of homozygous mutations (reflecting the high rate of consanguinity) may potentially offer further insights on genotype-phenotype correlation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson disease patients present with any of several neurologic phenotypes, and their treated outcomes vary widely. Our goal was to determine whether presenting clinical features of neurologic Wilson disease (WD) predict longer term neurologic outcomes in patients receiving anticopper treatment.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in four WD treatment trials received a standardized neurologic examination at trial enrollment and then at pre-specified intervals following anticopper therapy, initially with tetrathiomolybdate or trientine and then with zinc. The examination scored patients' motor signs, including tremor, rigidity, dystonia, dyarthria, and gait. The Total Score was obtained by summing these subscores. Eighty-six patients were included in our analysis, with a mean follow-up of 34.7 months. Retrospectively, the analysis compared scaled and unscaled sign subscores at enrollment and follow-up with change in the Total Score, using a generalized estimating equations approach.
RESULTS: In the primary analysis, improvement in the Total Score was best predicted by sign subscores for tremor (beta -0.7, p = 0.006), gait abnormalities (beta -3.7, p < 0.001), and speech (beta = -1.3, p = 0.05). Dystonia (beta = 1.8, p < 0.001) and facial expression (beta = 1.9, p = 0.03) were associated with worsening Total Score. Of the motor signs followed individually, dystonia proved most resistant to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale prospectively acquired study assessing prognostic significance of specific neurologic signs in WD. Our data support the historical observations that tremor is a favorable prognostic sign while dystonia is relatively refractory to treatment in WD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term data on the clinical follow-up and the treatment effectiveness of Wilson's disease are limited because of the low disease frequency. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of Wilson's disease patients from southern Brazil during a 40-year follow-up period.
METHODS: Thirty-six Wilson's disease patients, diagnosed from 1971 to 2010, were retrospectively evaluated according to their clinical presentation, epidemiological and social features, response to therapy and outcome.
RESULTS: Examining the patients' continental origins showed that 74.5% had a European ancestor. The mean age at the initial symptom presentation was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months until definitive diagnosis. At presentation, hepatic symptoms were predominant (38.9%), followed by mixed symptoms (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were identified in 55.6% of patients, with a higher frequency among those patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%). Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was detected in 68% of the patients with hepatic symptoms. 94.2% of all the patients were treated with D-penicillamine for a mean time of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combined therapy and liver transplantation. After initiating therapy, 78.8% of the patients had a stable or improved outcome, and the overall survival rate was 90.1%.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a population of Wilson's disease patients of mainly European continental origin who live in southern Brazil. Wilson's disease is treatable if correctly diagnosed, and an adequate quality of life can be achieved, resulting in a long overall survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. When treated, the outcome can be excellent, although the long-term survival has yet to be well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with WD and to assess those factors affecting the phenotypic manifestation of WD.
METHODS: The presence of mutations to the ATP7B gene, the clinical manifestations, treatments and the long-term outcomes were analysed retrospectively in 117 patients with WD (59 men and 58 women, aged at evaluation 38.5 +/- 11, range 16-63 years).
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with a neurological presentation, 51 patients with a hepatic presentation and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed up for an average of 15.1 +/- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most frequent genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with either the hepatic or the neurological presentation (P = 0.099). d-penicillamine or zinc salts (81 and 17% respectively) were used for treatment, and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic patients became asymptomatic, or improved, during the follow-up (82% patients with hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). The long-term survival of patients with WD did not differ from that of the general Czech population (P = 0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory response in the great majority of adequately treated patients with WD and survival coincides with that of the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive defect of cellular copper export. Early diagnosis in children is difficult due to its obscure clinical presentations. The efficacy of zinc salts is well documented, although there are limited data concerning zinc use in pediatric patients with WD.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical features, laboratory results and treatment responses in children with WD diagnosed at Taichung Veterans General Hospital between 1996 and 2008. Diagnosis was established by low serum ceruloplasmin, high 24-hour urinary copper excretion, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and mutation analysis.
RESULTS: Eleven children were included in this study. The main initial presentations were impaired liver function tests (6/11) and hemolytic anemia (2/11). Gene studies in seven children showed six different mutations (G934D, R778Q, C490X, 304insC, IVS4-1 G > C, P992I) and one possible novel mutation (L1181P). All patients had improved liver function tests and hemoglobin levels after treatment with D-penicillamine, trientine and zinc supplement therapy. During a mean period of 3.4 +/- 2.1 years with zinc therapy, six patients had serum zinc levels above the normal limit, and seven patients had serum copper levels below the normal range.
CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper examinations could be used to rule out WD in children with chronic hepatitis and hemolytic anemia. Gene analysis is helpful for prompt diagnosis of asymptomatic siblings and patients with atypical features. Zinc treatment is generally safe in pediatric patients with WD. However, its adverse effects should be monitored.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the progression of hepatic histopathology in serial liver biopsies from Wilson disease (WD) patients.
METHODS: We report a group of 12 WD patients treated with zinc and/or penicillamine who underwent multiple follow-up liver biopsies. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were gathered and all patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy.
RESULTS: Time to repeat biopsy ranged from 2 to 12 years. Six patients (non-progressors) showed stable hepatic histology or improvement. In one case, we observed improvement of fibrosis from stage 2 to 0. Six patients (progressors) had worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the histological findings and serum aminotransferases or copper metabolism parameters. The hepatic copper concentration reached normal levels in only two patients: one from the non-progressors and one from the progressors group. The estimated rate of progression of hepatic fibrosis in the entire group was 0 units per year in the time frame between the first and the second liver biopsy (4 years), and 0.25 between the second and the third (3 years). In the progressors group, the rate of progression of liver fibrosis was estimated at 0.11 fibrosis units per year between the first and second biopsy and, 0.6 fibrosis units between the second and third biopsy.
CONCLUSION: The inability of clinical tools to detect fibrosis progression in WD suggests that a liver biopsy with hepatic copper quantification every 3 years should be considered.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the different levels of copper and zinc in the serum, urine, and scalp hair of patients with Wilson's disease receiving different, currently accepted methods of treatment to reduce the copper load (penicillamine-group 1, n = 8; zinc-group 2, n = 8; penicillamine+zinc-group 3, n = 8). Blood, urine, and hair samples were collected from the patients. All three treatments resulted in a significant decrease of the serum copper levels. Significantly increased levels of zinc in the serum were detected in the patients in groups 2 and 3 (19.1 and 18.8 micromol/l, respectively; p < 0.05). Copper excretion in the urine significantly increased during its administration to groups 1 and 3 (11.5 and 7.94 micromol/24 h respectively; p < 0.001) due to the effect of penicillamine. The administration of zinc as monotherapy (group 2) or in combination with penicillamine (group 3) led to an increase of its excretion (25.3 and 22.4 micromol/24 h, respectively; p < 0.01). Only an insignificant rise of the copper content in the hair was found in all three groups of patients. The content of zinc in the hair did not differ significantly in any of the groups in comparison with the control group.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate survival rates, prognostic factors, and causes of death in Wilson disease (WD).
METHODS: In the years 1980-2007, a cohort of 142 patients with WD was prospectively registered (54 presented with neurologic symptoms, 49 with hepatic symptoms, 33 had mixed form, and data were missing for six patients). The duration of follow-up for patients alive was 11.1 +/- 8.8 years.
RESULTS: After initiation of treatment (d-penicillamine and zinc salts), 79% of patients had a stable or improved course of disease. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, 15 patients still had a relentlessly progressive course. Thirty patients died. The cumulative probability of survival in a 15-year period for the whole group was 76.7 +/- 4.9%. Better prognosis of WD was associated with male sex, younger age at onset, neurologic form of the disease, and treatment continuity. Causes of death were predominantly related to hepatic failure (16 patients), but also suicide (four patients) and cancer (three patients).
CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively early diagnosis and treatment of our patients with WD, mortality was still considerably high.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Affected children may be entirely asymptomatic and the diagnosis problematic. Herein we present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 57 children with WD and point out the diagnostic difficulties in a pediatric population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 57 consecutive children with WD. Evaluation included detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory testing, genetic analysis, and liver biopsy.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.27 +/- 3.62 years (range 4 months-18 years). Twenty patients were symptomatic, 19 were referred because of abnormal liver function test results and/or hepatomegaly, and 18 received their diagnoses after family screening. Twenty-two patients had both Kayser-Fleischer ring and decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, 13 had urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge >1600 microg/24 hours, and 3 had liver copper content >250 microg/g dry weight. Of the remaining 19 patients, 17 had both low serum ceruloplasmin <or=20 mg/dL and increased urinary copper excretion, >75 microg/24 hours before, or >1000 microg/24 hours after penicillamine challenge. In 2 patients with equivocal cases who had serum ceruloplasmin 26 mg/dL, the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis. No correlation was found between specific mutations and the disease phenotypic expression. Chelating therapy was well tolerated, and the outcome was satisfactory.
CONCLUSIONS: WD in children may be obscure and requires extensive investigation to establish the diagnosis. Genetic analysis is needed in equivocal cases.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the prevalence of the ATP7B gene mutation in patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease (WD) in Lithuania.
METHODS: Eleven unrelated Lithuanian families, including 13 WD patients were tested. Clinically WD diagnosis was established in accordance to the Leipzig scoring system. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole venous blood using a salt precipitation method. Firstly, the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation. Patients not homozygous for the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation were further analyzed. The 21 exons of the WD gene were amplified in a thermal cycler (Biometra T3 Thermocycler, Gottingen, Germany). Direct sequencing of the amplified PCR products was performed by cycle sequencing using fluorescent dye terminators in an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).
RESULTS: Total of 13 WD patients (mean age 26.4 years; range 17-40; male/female 3/10) presented with hepatic disorders and 16 their first degree relatives (including 12 siblings) were studied. Some of WD patients, in addition to hepatic symptoms, have had extrahepatic disorders (hemolytic anemia 3; Fanconi syndrome 1; neurophsychiatric and behavioural disorder 2). Liver biopsy specimens were available in all of 13 WD patients (8 had cirrhosis; 1-chronic hepatitis; 3-acute liver failure, 1-liver steatosis). Twelve of 13 (92.3%) WD patients had the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation, 6 of them in both chromosomes, 6 were presented as compound heterozygotes with additional c.3472-82delGGTTTAACCAT, c.3402delC, c.3121C>T (p.R1041W) or unknown mutations. For one patient with liver cirrhosis and psychiatric disorder (Leipzig score 6), no mutations were found. Out of 16 first degree WD relatives, 11 (68.7%) were heterozygous for the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation. Two patients with fulminant WD died from acute liver failure and 11 are in full remission under penicillamine or zinc acetate treatment. Three women with WD successfully delivered healthy babies.
CONCLUSION: The c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) missense mutation is the most characteristic mutation for Lithuanian patients with WD. Even 92.3% of WD patients with hepatic presentation of the disease are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for the p.H1069Q mutation.

TI  - Withdrawal of penicillamine from zinc sulphate-penicillamine maintenance therapy in Wilson's disease: promising, safe and cheap
AU  - Sinha, S.
AU  - Taly, A. B.
T2  - Journal of the Neurological Sciences
AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillamine, once considered the cornerstone of treatment for Wilson disease (WD), is rather expensive and toxic, and often causes neurological worsening. Zinc sulphate, aiming at the treatment of free-copper toxicosis, has emerged as effective, safe and cheap alternative.
AIM: To assess the effect of withdrawal of penicillamine from maintenance treatment with penicillamine and zinc sulphate.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients of WD (M:F: 28:17; age at diagnosis: 13.5+/-63 years), on both penicillamine (P) and zinc sulphate (Zn), couldn't continue penicillamine due to financial constraints. Their clinical data, disability and impairment scores (Schwab and England (S&E) score, Neurological Symptom Score (NSS), and Chu staging) and follow-up data of patients maintained only on zinc sulphate were recorded.
RESULTS: Majority of patients (84.4%) had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The mean duration of treatment with penicillamine (P) and zinc sulphate (P+Zn), before stopping penicillamine, was 107.4+/-67.3 months. 40 patients improved variably, while the rest didn't. They received only zinc sulphate for 27.2+/-8.5 months (range: 12 to 34) and 44 patients (97.7%) remained status quo or improved marginally. Only one patient reported worsening in dysarthria. Their disability and impairment scores during combination (penicillamine and zinc sulphate) and Zn alone were: Chu (1.3+/-0.5 vs. 1.5+/-1.9; p=0.4), NSS (1.8+/-3.1 vs. 1.5+/-2.3; p=0.03) and S&E (96.4+/-5.6 vs. 98.6+/-3.5; p=0.03). There were no adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of penicillamine from zinc sulphate/penicillamine maintenance therapy for patients with Wilson's disease was effective, safe and economic, for almost all patients. This retrospective study reiterates that zinc sulphate may be used as a preferred mode of treatment for patients with Wilson's disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown, and there is a paucity of data on the real presence and progression of iron accumulation. The purpose of this study was to assess the iron metabolism parameters, including hepatic iron concentration, in follow-up liver biopsies and serum, and urinary pro-hepcidin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three Wilson's disease patients undergoing long-term treatment were enrolled in the study.
RESULTS: Hepatic iron content was significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared with zinc-treated patients. Serum and urinary pro-hepcidin concentrations were significantly higher in Wilson's disease patients than in healthy volunteers, despite a normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term penicillamine treatment seems to be responsible for a more marked iron accumulation in the liver. This observation may justify a revision of long-term Wilson's disease treatment modalities with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary pro-hepcidin is significantly increased in Wilson's disease patients compared with healthy volunteers suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, but this needs to be confirmed by a study of hepatic hepcidin expression in these patients.

TI  - Cause of death in Wilson disease
AU  - Walshe, J. M.
T2  - Movement Disorders
AB  - Before 1948, all patients with Wilson disease died shortly after diagnosis. In 1948, BAL (dimercaprol) was introduced as a possible effective treatment, to be followed by penicillamine (1955), zinc salts (1961), trientine (1969), liver transplantation (1982), and tetrathiomolybdate (1984). Despite this wide range of therapeutic options, patients still die. This article examines the cause of death in 67 patients (33 men, 34 women) out of a series of 300 seen between 1948 and 2000. Patients were classified according to their presentation as neurological, 32 patients, hepatic 11, mixed hepatic/neurological 10, hemolytic, 6, and "sibling biopsy " 8. Diagnostic failure was the principal cause of death but there were multiple other causes of which the principal was poor compliance and the development of malignant disease after 10 years of follow-up. The development of new symptoms should alert the physician to the possibility of a new pathology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of and adherence to trientine and/or zinc therapy in children with Wilson disease (WD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of all children with WD in the pediatric liver/liver transplant program at our institution between 1998 and 2006.
RESULTS: A total of 22 children with WD were evaluated and treated. Seven with fulminant disease required liver transplantation and 15 were treated with trientine and/or zinc. Ten of those 15 had follow-up for 12 to 60 months and 6 of the latter 10 were followed for 12 to 18 months. All 10 patients were started on a trientine treatment regimen. Mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased from 183 +/- 103 IU at presentation (n = 10) to 80 +/- 46 IU at 12 months (n = 10) and 66 +/- 40 IU at 18 months (n = 7). Mean 24-hour urinary copper levels increased from 156 microg at presentation to 494 microg at 1 to 2 months, then decreased to 71 microg after 21 to 24 months of treatment. Three of 10 patients had normalized ALT levels and 1 patient with cirrhosis continued with normal ALT levels since presentation. Four of 10 patients were documented to be nonadherent, as manifested by increased ALT levels (99 +/- 31 IU); 1 patient had previously normalized ALT levels. In 3 of 10 patients, ALT level decreased but remained at an abnormal level (93 +/- 53 IU).
CONCLUSIONS: Trientine and/or zinc therapy is effective for children with WD. Nonadherence is a common cause of increased aminotransferase levels in patients with WD.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of Wilson disease (WD) are varied and challenging. We conducted the current study to present the phenotypic characteristics and follow-up for a large cohort of patients with WD. We reviewed the medical records of 282 cases of WD (male:female ratio, 196:86) for clinical features, investigations, treatment, and outcome data. The clinical presentations were as follows: hepatic, 42 (14.9%); hepato-neurologic, 10 (3.5%); neurologic, 195 (69.1%); pure psychiatric, 7 (2.4%); osseomuscular, 6 (2.1%); and "presymptomatic," 15 (5.3%). Mean age was 15.9 years. Presymptomatic patients and those with the hepatic form of WD were younger and patients with osseomuscular and psychiatric forms were older than neurologic patients. The mean duration of illness at the time of diagnosis was 28 months. Predominant neurologic features were as follows: parkinsonism, 62.3%; dystonia, 35.4%; cerebellar, 28%; pyramidal signs, 16%; chorea, 9%; athetosis, 2.2%; myoclonus, 3.4%; and behavioral abnormalities, 16%. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings were seen as follows: neurologic patients, 100%; hepatic patients, 86%; and presymptomatic patients, 59%. Positive family history was noted in 47% and consanguinity in 54%. Patients born of consanguineous parents had an earlier age of onset and shorter duration of illness before presentation. Serum ceruloplasmin was decreased in 93% and 24-hour urinary copper excretion was increased in 70% of patients. Neuroimaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) and electrophysiologic abnormalities were seen in many patients. Overall, 195 patients were on D-penicillamine therapy and 182 on zinc sulphate. Follow-up data, available for 225 patients, for a mean duration of 46 months, revealed improvement in 176, no change in 20, and deterioration in 6. Twenty-three patients died. To conclude, despite increased awareness and recognition and significant inroads into therapeutic frontiers, follow-up remains poor in developing countries and a return to previous level of functioning is not universal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is a rare inborn disease related to copper storage, leading to liver cirrhosis and neuropsychological deterioration. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited owing to low disease frequency.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 163 patients with Wilson's disease, examined at the University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, to determine clinical presentation, diagnostic course and long-term outcome.
RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria for non-caeruloplasmin-bound serum copper, serum caeruloplasmin, 24-h urinary copper excretion, liver copper content, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and histological signs of chronic liver damage were reached in 86.6%, 88.2%, 87.1%, 92.7%, 66.3% and 73% of patients, respectively. By analysis of the coding region of ATP7B (except exons 2, 3 and 21), disease-causing mutations were detected in 57% and 29% of patients with Wilson's disease on both chromosomes and on one chromosome, respectively. No mutations were detected in 15% of patients with Wilson's disease. No significant differences were found in clinical parameters or initial presentation between patients grouped according to their mutations. The patients with neurological symptoms were significantly older at the onset of symptoms than patients with hepatitic symptoms (20.2 v 15.5 years of age, p<0.05), and the neurological symptoms were associated with a significantly longer time from onset to diagnosis than hepatic symptoms (44.4 v 14.4 months, p<0.05). After initiating treatment, 76.1% of the patients had a stable or improved course of the disease. Disease progression under treatment was more likely for neuropsychiatric than for hepatic symptoms. Side effects of treatment occurred in 74.4% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Wilson's disease having predominantly neuropsychiatric symptoms manifest symptoms later, have a longer time delay from onset of symptoms until definitive diagnosis and have a poorer outcome than patients with hepatic symptoms.

AB  - AIMS: To report on the diagnostic features, management, and clinical outcome after different treatments of Wilson's disease patients followed over a mean period of 15 years.
PATIENTS: Thirty-five patients with Wilson's disease referred to the University of Padova's Department of Gastroenterology for diagnosis or treatment were observed for a mean 15 years. The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urinary, and hepatic copper concentrations), and uptake of the radiostable isotope Cu into the plasma protein pool. Hepatic Cu content was measured by regular follow-up biopsies. Neurologic outcome after therapy was assessed using a newly developed scoring system.
RESULTS: Twenty-three (65.7%) patients presented with liver disease; 12 (34.3%) had mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement. All patients had been initially treated with either penicillamine (23) or zinc sulfate (12). The neurologic symptoms became worse or remained stationary in 75% of those treated with penicillamine, whereas zinc treatment improved these symptoms in 90% of treated cases. Both treatments were effective in improving the hepatic symptoms. No differences in hepatic Cu content emerged between follow-up biopsies in either treatment group. Six patients (26%) had to abandon the penicillamine treatment due to side effects. In all, 4 patients underwent liver transplantation, which was successful in 3, with a mean survival after transplantation of 4.6 years; the fourth, who had a severe neurologic impairment, died of central pontine myelinolysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Penicillamine and zinc can effectively treat Wilson's disease, though the side effects of penicillamine may be severe enough to prompt its suspension. Liver transplantation remains the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We carried out this study to evaluate recent clinical features of Wilson's disease (WD) with hepatic presentation, especially in terms of age, degree of liver injury, and association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Sixteen patients with hepatic manifestations were diagnosed with WD in the period 1976-2003. We divided this period into two periods, "past" and "recent". The diagnosis was based on the presence of Kayser-Fleisher rings, low serum copper levels, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge, and increased hepatic copper concentrations. This retrospective study was done at Ehime University Hospital.
RESULTS: Four patients, including a pair of siblings, had a family history of WD. Four patients had parental consanguinity. There were 6 patients aged over 40 years in the recent period, whereas no patients in the past period were over 40. Four patients had neurological manifestations. Ten patients had liver cirrhosis and 5 had chronic hepatitis. Two had fatty liver without obesity. All patients in the past period had liver cirrhosis. Three patients with liver cirrhosis were found to have HCC during the follow up. All patients were treated with either D-penicillamine or trientine chloride, or both. However, four patients had to discontinue these agents due to the side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Recently, the number of patients diagnosed with WD has been increasing, not only in terms of those with classical-type WD but also in terms of elderly patients or patients with non-cirrhotic liver injury such as fatty liver and chronic hepatitis. The various clinical features of WD should be recognized and particular attention should focus on HCC as a complication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Causative treatment of genetically determined Wilson's disease (WD) has been impossible so far, although gene therapy could be real in the future. Nowadays the principle of treatment is the elimination of the excess of easily mobilized copper, bound by chelating agents, the most important of which is d-penicillamine, through the kidneys. Blocking of the intestinal absorption of copper by administration of zinc preparations, which additionally induce hepatic metallothionein synthesis, is also possible. The aim of our study was to present own observations and results of treatment of Wilson's disease.
MATERIAL/METHODS: During the last 16 years, we have observed 33 patients aged 13-60 (mean age 27 years) with various forms of WD. The studied group consisted of 11 females and 21 males, admitted to hospital or seen at the Specialistic Outpatient Department of Hepatology with various diagnoses. In addition to standard laboratory tests, the levels of ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper, as well as the activity of some hepatic enzymes, proteins and HBV/HCV infection markers were determined. The patients were also examined by a neurologist and an ophthalmologist, with psychiatric consultation if necessary. Taking into account the overall clinical presentation, the patients were divided into the following groups according to the form of the disease: fulminant, acute, hepatic, hepatic with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, neuropsychiatric, asymptomatic.
RESULTS: All the patients were initially treated with d-penicillamine. In most of them, no side effects were observed. The treatment was continued according to the levels of copper excreted with urine (for 10 years at the longest). After obtaining clinical improvement with reduced amount of copper excreted with 24-h urine, we tapered d-penicillamine doses or even discontinued the drug, introducing zinc preparations. In asymptomatic carriers, zinc preparations were used throughout the period of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Early institution of chelation treatment is associated with good prognosis both in hepatic and neurological forms of WD. Zinc preparations are effective and safe in neurological and oligosymptomatic forms of the disease.

AB  - We have treated 9 patients who presented with hepatic decompensation resulting from Wilson's disease with a combination of trientine and zinc, generally for at least 4 months, followed by transition to zinc maintenance therapy. All of these patients had hypoalbuminemia, all but 1 had hyperbilirubinemia, and 7 had ascites. All of these patients would have been candidates for liver transplantation on the basis of their initial Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. The minimal listing criteria for transplant candidates is a score greater than 7. Eight of the 9 patients had demonstrated a CTP score of 10 or higher. The other scoring system that has been used in Wilson's disease to determine need for transplantation is the prognostic index of Nazer, in which a score over 6 indicates that the patient is unlikely to survive without a transplant if treated with penicillamine. Two of our patients had Nazer scores higher than 6. With our medical therapy, all 9 of these patients have recovered normal liver function as reflected by normalization of their CTP scores to 5. Because of coexisting neurologic disease, 1 of our 9 patients was initiated on a neurologic protocol and by chance randomized to receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and zinc after 2 weeks of trientine/zinc treatment. This patient's liver function recovered much more rapidly than did that of the other 8 patients, all of whom were treated with trientine/zinc, suggesting that TM therapy offers a further advantage. In summary, we were able to take 9 patients who presented with liver failure -8 of whom had CTP scores indicating a potential need for liver transplantation and 2 of whom had Nazer prognostic scores indicating that they were not likely to survive if treated only with penicillamine - and treat them medically, with recovery in all 9. We believe the trientine/zinc combination therapy should be the standard for initial treatment of liver failure in Wilson's disease because its efficacy is equal or slightly superior to that of penicillamine and because it has a much lower incidence of side effects. Moreover, TM warrants study to determine whether therapy for hepatic Wilson's disease can be further improved.

AB  - Thirty patients with Wilson's disease (WD) were observed at a movement disorder clinic between 1970 and 2000. Disease onset was at the mean age (SD) of 14.5 (+/-5.9) years. Presentation with hepatic disease occurred in 12 of 30 patients and with neurologic disease in 15. Three patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The mean (SD) delay to diagnosis was 5.9 (+/-5.7) years. Five patients diagnosed in an advanced stage of disease died before initiating treatment. Eighteen patients were followed and treated with D-penicillamine alone or in combination with zinc sulphate. Treatment improved most of neurological symptoms. Dystonic postures, behavioural disturbances and dysarthria were the most resistant neurological signs. 'Pseudo-sclerotic' neurologic involvement predicted a good outcome, whereas hepatic onset and 'classic' neurologic involvement were associated with a poorer prognosis. Two of the 18 treated patients died of hepatic failure due to voluntary discontinuation of therapy. Both D-penicillamine and zinc sulphate were well tolerated. No teratogenic effect of D-penicillamine was observed throughout 5 pregnancies. Our results suggest that D-penicillamine or a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc sulphate is a safe and effective long-term treatment in patients with WD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear what anticopper drug to use for patients with Wilson disease who present with neurologic manifestations because penicillamine often makes them neurologically worse and zinc is slow acting.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of neurologic worsening and drug adverse effects with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate.
DESIGN: Open-label study of 55 untreated patients (22 of them new) presenting with neurologic Wilson disease treated with tetrathiomolybdate varying from 120 to 410 mg/d for 8 weeks and then followed up for 3 years. Neurologic function was assessed with scored neurologic and speech tests.
SETTING: A university hospital referral setting.
PATIENTS: All untreated, newly diagnosed patients with neurologic Wilson disease.
INTERVENTION: Treatment with tetrathiomolybdate.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurologic function was evaluated by neurologic and speech examinations. Drug adverse effects were evaluated by complete blood cell counts and biochemical measures.
RESULTS: Only 2 (4%) of 55 patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate showed neurologic deterioration, compared with an estimated 50% of penicillamine-treated patients. Five of the 22 new patients exhibited bone marrow suppression and 3 had aminotransferase elevations. These numbers are higher than in the original 33 patients and appear to be due primarily to a more rapid dose escalation.
CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate shows excellent efficacy in patients with Wilson disease who present with neurologic manifestations. With rapid escalation of dose, adverse effects from bone marrow suppression or aminotransferase elevations can occur.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease, heralded by severe hepatic insufficiency, is a rare disorder for which emergency liver transplantation is considered to be the only effective therapy.
AIMS: To report the features of Wilson's disease with severe hepatic insufficiency in a series of 17 patients and, during the second period of the study, to assess the efficacy of a policy consisting of early administration of D-penicillamine.
PATIENTS: Seventeen consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. During the first period of the study (up to 1979), none of the patients received D-penicillamine. During the second period (after 1979), all patients without encephalopathy at admission received D-penicillamine.
RESULTS: The four patients observed during the first period who did not have encephalopathy at admission and did not receive D-penicillamine progressed to encephalopathy and died. Among the 13 consecutive patients observed during the second period, two patients with encephalopathy at admission did not receive D-penicillamine and were transplanted. The 11 remaining patients all received D-penicillamine. Ten of these patients survived without the need for transplantation and returned to compensated liver disease without liver insufficiency. In one patient, liver insufficiency progressed and transplantation had to be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with Wilson's disease heralded by severe hepatic insufficiency and without encephalopathy at admission, early administration of D-penicillamine was associated with survival without transplantation. These results suggest the importance of early diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease before the onset of encephalopathy, and favour early administration of D-penicillamine which could avoid the need for transplantation in most cases.

TI  - Wilson's disease--early onset and lessons from a pediatric cohort in India

T2  - Indian Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile at presentation and on follow up in cases of Wilson's disease presenting at this hospital.
METHODS: Case records of children diagnosed as Wilson's disease (WD) admitted in the hospital or attending the Pediatric outpatient department were retrospectively studied with regard to clinical features, investigations, and family screening at the time of presentation. Note was made of the treatment received by the patients. Clinical profile on follow up was recorded with respect to side effects of treatment, and whether patient improved, deteriorated or remained the same, either from the records or by calling the patient for a follow up, if possible.
RESULTS: Analysis of 25 children with Wilson's disease comprising 19 index cases and 6 siblings detected on family screening, revealed mean age of onset for the hepatic presentation was 6.8 years versus 8 years for the neurologic patient. A quarter of index cases has a family history strongly suspicious for Wilson disease which has been earlier overlooked. Clinical presentation was hepatic in 5 patients, purely neurologic in 5, mixed hepatic and neurologic in 9, hemolytic anemia in 1 and polyarthritis in 1. Patients received treatment with D penicillamine, zinc, pyridoxine and low copper diet. Follow upon 18 patients revealed improvement in majority, residual dysarthria in seven,prolonged persistence of KF rings in 15 and complications like renal tubular acidosis with osteopenia in one.
CONCLUSION: The early age of onset of symptoms, prolonged KF rings persistence and progression of symptoms among sibs despite therapy is of interest as it may be related to a high copper intake, which may be due to the practice of using brass or copper utensils for cooking Since a large number of children has either a past history of jaundice or sibling deaths due to jaundice or cirrhosis, a high index of suspicion and screening for KF rings is emphasized as a simple and cost effective way of detecting a curable disease at an early stage and family screening of all index cases is imperative. Progression of symptoms among sibs on oral zinc and low dose pencillamine suggests inadequacy of zinc alone for prophylaxis.

T2  - Indian Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical, laboratory findings, treatment and long-term follow-up of children with Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation.
DESIGN: Retrospective study with a median follow-up period of 9 years.
SETTING: University medical center.
SUBJECTS: Thirty-four children with hepatic involvement, ranging in age from three to fifteen years, were diagnosed as Wilson's disease over an eighteen year period.
METHODS: The diagnosis was based on the presence of family history and Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary and hepatic copper concentrations.
RESULTS: Four patients had also neurological manifestations. Eight patients were diagnosed as fulminating hepatic failure resulting in death in a few days. The most common symptoms were abdominal distension and abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly was the predominant physical finding and serum transaminases were elevated in most of the patients. Twenty patients had cirrhosis and six had chronic hepatitis histopathologically. All patients with fulminating hepatic failure had hyperbilirubinemia with normal alkaline phosphatase and higher aspartate aminotransferase than alanine aminotransferase. Patients were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulphate. Three patients underwent liver transplantation. Four more patients besides patients with fulminating hepatic failure died due to end stage liver disease. Twenty-two patients were followed for median 9 years. Four patients with poor compliance progressed to decompensated cirrhosis and the others were stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver disease with unknown origin with positive family history and parental consanguinity should imply Wilson's disease strongly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and toxic effects of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of a relatively large series of patients with neurologic symptoms and signs caused by Wilson disease. Two key aspects of efficacy are to preserve the neurologic function present at the onset of therapy and to maximize the opportunity for long-term recovery.
DESIGN: An open study of 33 patients treated for 8 weeks each, including further follow-up data on the original 17 patients. Neurologic function was evaluated by frequent quantitative neurologic and speech pathology examinations. Several copper-related variables were studied to evaluate the effect of the drug on copper, and several biochemical and clinical variables were studied to evaluate potential toxic effects. Patients were then followed up at yearly intervals, with follow-up periods of 1 to 8 years reported.
SETTING: A university hospital referral setting.
INTERVENTION: Patients were generally treated for 8 weeks with tetrathiomolybdate, followed by zinc maintenance therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurologic function was evaluated by quantitative neurologic and motor speech examinations and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain.
RESULTS: During the 8 weeks of tetrathiomolybdate administration, only 1 of the 33 patients showed deterioration in neurologic function. Copper status and potential further toxic effects were generally well controlled quickly. Evaluation of data from individual patients revealed evidence of a toxic side effect in only 1 patient, who exhibited reversible anemia. During the ensuing period of follow-up of 1 to 6 years, neurologic recovery in most patients was good to excellent.
CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent form of initial treatment in patients with Wilson disease who present with neurologic symptoms and signs. In contrast to penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate rarely allows further, often irreversible, neurologic deterioration.

AB  - Delayed response to medical treatment sometimes leads to unnecessary liver transplantation in patients with severely decompensated Wilson disease. We report the course of five patients (mean age 13.4 years, range 11 to 15 years) with severely decompensated Wilson disease who were successfully treated medically. Prothrombin time improved after a minimum of 1 month and returned to normal within 3 months to 1 year or more.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that the level of serum copper unbound to ceruloplasmin (loosely bound copper) is increased in Wilson's disease, although the total serum copper concentration is usually low, reflecting a low ceruloplasmin level. To assess the contribution of free radical reactions catalyzed by nonceruloplasmin copper to the development of complications in this disease, we investigated copper and antioxidant status in four untreated patients who had hepatic dysfunction with or without hemolytic anemia and made a comparison with five patients controlled on penicillamine therapy and 19 age-matched healthy children. We found that loosely bound copper in plasma measured by the phenanthroline assay was detectable in three of four untreated patients with Wilson's disease, but was not detectable in the patients during therapy or in the healthy controls. Among the various antioxidants, the ascorbate and urate levels were markedly reduced before treatment (mean +/- SD, 23 +/- 16 microM for ascorbate and 90 +/- 59 microM for urate) compared with the values in the patients during treatment with penicillamine (67 +/- 19 and 302 +/- 78 microM, p < 0.05) and in control children (60 +/- 8 and 254 +/- 48 microM, p < 0.05). We also demonstrated that the plasma concentration of allantoin, an oxidation product of uric acid and a possible marker of radical generation in vivo, was markedly elevated in the untreated patients (11.0 +/- 1.8 versus 4.3 +/- 0.5 microM in patients on therapy and 6.5 +/- 0.8 microM in controls, p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Previous Indian studies have high-lighted the neurological manifestations of this disorder. Eleven patients with Wilson's disease with different hepatic manifestations are reported.
METHODS: Patients referred to the gastroenterology department of a tertiary referral center were investigated for Wilson's disease, based on clinical suspicion, with slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper estimation. Liver biopsy was done whenever possible.
RESULTS: Patients with Wilson's disease presented as acute viral hepatitis (n = 5), fulminant hepatic failure (n = 2), subacute hepatic failure (n = 2) and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2). Therapy with penicillamine/trientene and zinc sulphate was started in 9 patients; 5 showed good response to therapy, one had to be switched to trientene due to penicillamine toxicity, two died, and one was lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease has varied hepatic presentations and should be suspected in all patients with unexplained liver disease. Any young adult presenting with acute hepatitis or fulminant hepatic failure who has evidence of underlying chronic liver disease or associated hemolytic anemia should be investigated for Wilson's disease. Therapy with penicillamine or trientene combined with zinc sulphate shows improvement in a majority of patients.

AB  - Certain features of Wilson's disease (WD) in Asia have been found to be different from those in other continents. The higher prevalence rate in Japan is presumably due to a higher consanguinity rate. In Chinese there is a tight linkage between WD and two gene loci for esterase D and retinoblastoma in the long arm of chromosome 13. The high proportion of patients with hepatic presentation accounts for early onset of WD in the Japanese and Chinese series. Skeletal involvement, leg hyperpigmentation, dark complexion, amenorrhea, epileptic seizures, and cerebral white matter degeneration are relatively more common among WD patients in Asia. Excessive copper in the liver appears to have a protective effect against hepatocellular carcinoma and type B hepatitis. Electrophysiological studies suggest widespread functional disturbances of the CNS in WD. Side-effects from penicillamine are rather frequent and often lead to interruption of the therapy. Trien is found to be effective without adverse reactions. Oral zinc therapy may be a suitable alternative for long-term management of WD patients in developing Asian countries. [References: 77]

AB  - The results of chelation treatment of 137 patients presenting with neurological Wilson's disease are described, together with the more commonly observed toxic reactions to the various drugs employed. Fifty-seven patients made an excellent response to treatment and became symptom free. Thirty-six patients made a good recovery, but were left with some minor neurological deficit. Twenty-four patients had a poor response: although the disease process was arrested they were left more or less disabled. Twenty patients died: nine had little or no treatment, but 11 died despite apparently adequate chelation therapy. There was no obvious reason for this failure. The liver copper level was estimated in six of these patients: it was still significantly elevated in only one, but in all four in whom it was possible to make the determination, the concentration of copper in the basal ganglia was in excess of 45 micrograms/g wet weight. It was not apparent why adequate therapy failed to remove copper from the brains of these patients. There was no obvious clinical, histological or biochemical indicator of failure to respond to treatment. Initial deterioration before improvement was seen in 30 patients: the prognosis for a useful recovery was not necessarily worse than that in patients who did not show this phenomenon.

AB  - Twenty of 320 patients with Wilson's disease initially presented with chemical and laboratory features of chronic active hepatitis, confirmed histologically in 17. When first seen, cirrhosis was present in all 20 and was complicated by ascites and/or jaundice in 11. Within 1 week to 8 years of the onset of over liver disease the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established, and treatment with D-penicillamine was promptly initiated in 19 patients. One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention, for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine, disappeared in all but 1 of the patients so affected. Symptomatic improvement and virtually normal levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase followed within 1 year in the majority of subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. Two patients, who became noncompliant with the therapeutic regimen after 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological treatment, required liver transplants. These results indicate that the prognosis of specifically treated Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis is very good in spite of the presence of cirrhosis.

AB  - Triethylene tetramine (trien), in increasing dose from 1.0-2.0 g/day to 2.5-3.0 g/day, was used for 4 Japanese patients with Wilson's disease who were intolerant of D-penicillamine (D-PC). Before the treatment, urinary copper excretion (UCE) was 70-96 micrograms/day. UCE increased to 1,512-2,352 micrograms/day on the day of initial administration, and remained at levels between 350-1,100 micrograms/day, thereafter. During 2 months of trien therapy, neurological deficits regressed in three patients, and only slightly in one patient. No adverse effects were observed. These results and the retrospective survey on 17 patients treated with D-PC confirmed that trien is less potent but a safer copper chelating agent than D-PC. The transient aggravation of neurological deficits seen in two patients during the early stage of the treatment suggested that trien, as D-PC, should be started in small doses and gradually increased.

AB  - The prevalence and clinical features of Wilson's disease in Scotland were investigated. Thirty three cases were identified but adequate information was available on only 28. In 1989, the prevalence rate was 4 per million. Ten patients with a mean (SEM) age of 18 (1.9) years presented with neurological symptoms, 12 patients aged 14 (1.7) years presented with hepatic symptoms, and six patients aged 12 (0.9) years were asymptomatic siblings of patients with Wilson's disease. Nine (56%) of the 16 patients who underwent liver biopsy on presentation were found to have cirrhosis. Penicillamine treatment was stopped in nine patients because of: abnormal peripheral blood count (6), rash (2), and patient's own choice (1). Nineteen patients were alive in 1989 -12 were well, one had chronic liver failure, four chronic neurological disabilities, and two had both chronic liver failure and neurological disabilities. Twelve patients died from: complications of chronic liver failure (2), acute liver failure (4), pneumonia associated with immobility (4), and other causes (2). Several patients who died had received incomplete medical supervision.

AB  - Thirty-one patients with Wilson's disease were evaluated with detailed neurologic and medical examinations. Mean age (+/- SD) at onset was 21 +/- 5 years and at examination was 28 +/- 6 years. Of the 90% of patients who were first treated with penicillamine, 31% deteriorated initially despite therapy, and half never recovered to pretherapy baseline. At the time of our evaluations, the most common neurologic findings were dysarthria (97%), dystonia (65%), dysdiadochokinesia (58%), rigidity (52%), gait and postural abnormalities (42%), and tremor (32%). Chorea and dementia were rare. Twenty-two patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. All but one of the 19 symptomatic patients had abnormal scans. The three asymptomatic patients had normal scans. Most lesions were seen in the caudate, putamen, subcortical white matter, midbrain, and pons. Generalized brain atrophy was also common. Lesions were less common in the thalamus, cerebellar vermis, midbrain tegmentum, globus pallidus, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus. Dystonia and bradykinesia correlated with putamen lesions, and dysarthria correlated with both putamen and caudate lesions.

T2  - Journal of the Neurological Sciences
AB  - Evaluation of the literature concerning the various approaches for the treatment of Wilson's disease led to the conclusion that zinc sulphate might be a good choice because it is effective and relatively safe. Twenty seven patients were managed with zinc sulphate for a total period of 142 patients-years. The drug was administered in doses varying from 300 to 1200 mg/day. Of the 9 patients who were treated with zinc from the start, 8 improved and one died from severe cirrhosis. All 8 patients who were placed on zinc after intolerance to penicillamine did well on zinc therapy. Ten patients were changed to zinc after they had first been treated with penicillamine without developing signs of intolerance. Of this group 8 patients were kept on long-term zinc therapy, 2 were changed back to penicillamine because of personal preference. Signs of intolerance to zinc were not observed. All patients kept a diet containing about 1.2 mg of copper a day. Our experience supports the idea that zinc sulphate is a good choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease: the drug is effective, safe and cheap.

AB  - Penicillamine is known to be effective therapy for Wilson's disease. However, the clinical consequences of the abrupt and permanent withdrawal of penicillamine have not been investigated. We studied 11 patients who stopped their own treatment after having been treated successfully with penicillamine (1 to 2 g per day) for periods of 3 to 19 years. Eight died of hepatic decompensation or fulminant hepatitis after an average survival of only 2.6 years. In another 13 patients, penicillamine was discontinued by the physician because of serious adverse reactions. In these patients, penicillamine was replaced with trientine (1 to 1.5 g per day), a newer chelating agent. All but one of these patients (who was killed accidentally) are alive at this writing, from 2 to 15 years later. Our observations suggest that discontinuation of penicillamine in patients with Wilson's disease results in rapid clinical deterioration, which is often fatal. The replacement of penicillamine with trientine appears to prevent this adverse clinical course.

AB  - The therapeutic responses of seven children with Wilson's disease who presented with neurological disease were evaluated. Neurological abnormalities comprised intellectual deterioration in 7, conduct disorder in five, dystonia in three, choreoathetosis in three, seizures in one and hemiparesis in one. Lethargy and weight loss were present for several months in 6 children. Four children had clinically demonstrable liver disease which was fatal in two. Electroencephalography performed in two children was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain in three children showed cerebral atrophy in all and areas of low attenuation in the basal ganglia which resolved on treatment in one. All patients were treated with penicillamine but, in four, triethylene tetramine (TETA) was substituted because of adverse effects. Neurological abnormalities in these patients were reversible.

AB  - The efficacy of zinc as a therapeutic agent to control copper balance in Wilson's disease patients has been previously documented with balance studies. In an attempt to develop a simpler and faster tool for evaluating the adequacy of zinc therapy, a technique that measures the uptake into blood of a small oral dose of 64copper was studied in conjunction with copper balance. The mean peak 64copper uptake into blood of nine Wilson's disease patients on D-penicillamine, trien, or no medication was 6.04 +/- 2.74%, comparable with normal controls. Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment. The data demonstrate that the prevention of copper uptake into blood in Wilson's disease patients by zinc therapy can be evaluated by 64copper uptake and that peak uptakes of less than 1% occur in patients with neutral or negative copper balance.

AU  - Walshe, J. M.

AB  - Twenty patients with Wilson's disease in whom severe penicillamine intolerance developed have been managed with the orally active chelating agent trientine dihydrochloride (trien). The stage of illness of the patients ranged from the presymptomatic through severe neurological or hepatic disease to the "decoppered" postsymptomatic cases. Trien has proved to be a safe and highly effective treatment both for reversing symptoms and for maintaining patients previously successfully decoppered with penicillamine. There has been evidence of depletion of the body stores of copper by trien coinciding with the clinical improvement. In most of the patients the toxic symptoms which forced a change of therapy were reversed on trien therapy; however, elastosis perforans did not seem to benefit, and two patients with penicillamine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus were not helped by the change. No other toxic signs or symptoms were observed. There was no evidence of teratogenicity either in animals or in the six patients who became pregnant while taking trien; all six infants have developed normally. Trien is a satisfactory alternative therapy for Wilson's disease; its usefulness, is however, severely limited by the lack of a product license.

AB  - Taking into consideration the manifold symptomatology of Wilson's disease on the one hand and the necessity of an early--possibly already at the asymptomatic stage before the 6th year of life--diagnostic ascertainment on the other hand, the diagnostic approach performed in the GDR is described. Furthermore, the directives of treatment and the successes of treatment are discussed as well as the various side-effects of the D-penicillamine therapy described, in which case the severe nephrotic syndromes are particularly considered.

AU  - Kalita, J.

T2  - Movement Disorders Clinical Practice
AB  - Background: Movement disorder is common in Wilson's disease (WD), but there is no report on oromandibular dystonia (OMD). We report on frequency, severity, and MRI correlation of OMD in Wilson's disease with neurological manifestations (WDNM) and its response to treatment. Methods: Consecutive WDNM patients were included and their clinical, hematological, serum chemistry, and MRI findings were noted. Neurological severity of WD and OMD were assessed. Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score for dystonia was noted. Patients were treated with penicillamine, zinc, and multiple antidystonic drugs. Clinical improvement at 3 and 6 months was noted. Results: Overall, 61 of 67 (91%) WDNM patients had OMD, whose median age was 13.5 years. Median severity of OMD was 2.5 (range, 1-4). Thirteen patients were anarthric and 12 unable to eat. Severity of OMD correlated with drooling (r = 0.29; P = 0.02), BFM score (r = 0.63; P < 0.001), pancytopenia (r = -0.26; P = 0.04), and serum ceruloplasmin (r = 0.33; P = 0.01), but not with location and number of MRI lesions. Compared to baseline, severity of OMD improved at 6 months (P < 0.001), but not at 3 months. None became asymptomatic. Improvement in OMD paralleled with improvement in severity grade of WDNM (r = 0.26; P = 0.04) and with BFM score (r = 0.31; P = 0.02). Conclusion: OMD was a common manifestation of WDNM occurring in 91% patients, and OMD improved partially over the study period.

TI  - Significant heterogeneity in the diagnosis and management of wilson disease (WD): Results from a large spanish registry
AU  - Berenguer, M.
T2  - Hepatology
AB  - There are areas of uncertainty regarding diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies in patients diagnosed with WD, one of the few rare diseases in Hepatology. Our aim was to assess in a large multicenter Spanish Registry whether the approach to WD diagnosis and management is homogenous among centers. METHODS: Observational, descriptive study of the GEMHEP (Spanish Group of Women Hepatologists) in which clinical and laboratory data on 126 WD patients followed at 28 Spanish hospitals were collected. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 20 (range: 1-74) years, 60% were men. Median follow-up (FU) was 16 yrs (1-44). The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (70%; median age: 18 yrs) followed by mixed (12%, median age: 33 yrs) and neurological (8%; median age: 23 yrs). In the remainder 10%, the diagnosis was done through family screening. Kayser-Fleisher ring and cirrhosis were present at diagnosis in one third of cases. Discordant results were observed regarding diagnostic non-invasive laboratory parameters in 58% of cases; while ceruplasmin (CP) levels were decreased in 88% of cases, 24hr cupruria was greater than 100 mcg/24hrs in only 43% of patients at diagnosis. Most patients had intrahepatic copper concentration performed with results compatible with WD in 79%. Genetic testing was done in half of the patients with mutations compatible with WD found in the majority (83%). DP and Zinc (Zn) were the most common initial therapies, used as single agents in 76% and 18% of patients, respectively. Treatment was modified during follow up in half of the patients at a mean of 8 yrs, mostly due to switch to a Zn-maintenance therapy (47% at a median of 7 yrs) or toxicity (39%, at a median of 2 yrs). Despite good adherence observed in 90% of patients, up to one third of patients had abnormal liver enzymes at last FU visit. Overweight and hypertension were more frequently present in these patients (p=.006 and 0.05). Additional data is being collected to perform a more thorough analysis of factors associated with lack of normalization of liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Discordant results regarding standard tests for WD diagnosis was frequent in our multicenter Spanish cohort. This variability may be due to lack of reproducibility between laboratories forcing to carry out invasive techniques in a substantial number of patients. Although the majority of patients start treatment with DP, switching to Zn due to either maintenance protocol and/or toxicity is the norm. In one third of cases, a complete normalization of liver enzymes was not reached, perhaps due to unrelated causes.

AB  - Introduction. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, leading to liver cirrhosis and neuropsychological deterioration. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited, owing to low disease frequency. Aim. Determine clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a cohort of patients from a French liver reference center. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with confirmed diagnosis of WD, examined in a liver reference center, at the Paul-Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France. Patients were evaluated clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Hepatic involvement was assessed with liver biopsy and/or liver stiffness measurement. Results. We included in this cohort 107 patients with hepatic symptoms of the WD, 54 (50.5%) females and 53 (49.5%) males, from 1974 to 2016. The mean follow up was 15 years with extremes from 1 to 44 years. Fifty-seven of 107 patients (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed symptoms, neurologic and hepatic) at admission. The mean age at diagnosis of WD was 20.1 (>10.54) years with a difference between the age concerning the "Hepatic group" for hepatic symptoms (17<=8.6 years) and the other goup with neurologic symptoms (23>11.4 years) (p=0.0081). Sixty-five patients (70%) had liver pathological analysis and 72 (67%) had liver stiffness measurement. Seventy-three patients (68%) had cirrhosis at diagnosis of the disease. Forty-three patients (76%) had cirrhosis among patients with mixed symptoms (neurologic and hepatic) and 30 (61%) in patients with isolated hepatic symptoms. Thirty-four of 107 patients (32%) were transplanted, at a mean age of 27 (>12.2) years. Among patients who required liver transplantation 18 (52%) had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) had fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) had severe neurological disease and 5 (14%) had liver cancer. The chelating treatment was very predominantly D Penicillamine, in 104/107 patients. A change in treatment was necessary in 37 (35%) patients because of adverse events to Trientine or Zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke and one after liver transplantation for severe neurological symptoms. Conclusion. At presentation of Wilson's Disease, two thirds of patients referred to a reference center of hepatology, had cirrhosis and one-third require liver transplantation. Cirrhosis is diagnosed in 76% patients who have neurological symptoms of the disease. Even if Wilson's Disease can be a severe disease, the prognosis is good for patients in charge in a specialized center.

AB  - Introduction. The standard treatment of Wilson disease (WD) is chelating copper agent or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of immediate severe liver failure or severe worsening under treatment. The indication of LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation remains controversial. Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of LT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods. This is a retrospective study. From 2002 to 2015, seventeen patients underwent a LT in France for severe neurological complications of WD without improvement despite medical treatment, without liver failure. All patients received chelating copper and 4 patients received chelating copper with zinc salts. Twelve patients presented a worsening after diagnosis of WD and 5 patients after a treatment interruption without improvement after a well-conducted treatment. Assessment of the severity of the disease was done with the Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS) before and after LT. Results. Main neurological symptoms combined dystonic postures (15/17), parkinsonian syndrome (9/17) and tremor (3/17). Mean age at diagnosis of WD was 17.9 [6-39] years and the interval time between worsening and LT was 12.6 [3-24] months. Mean age at LT was 20.2 [11-41] years. For all patients, an emergency procedure was needed to access to the transplantation. All patients had cirrhosis after analysis of the native liver. The CHILD score was A for all patients at the time of transplantation. The mean follow-up time after transplant was 51.8 [3-156] months. Survival was 84%, 75% and 66% at 1, 2 and 5 years respectively. For patients died after LT from severe sepsis, after an interval of 16 [1.5-36]. All of these 4 patients had a severe sepsis with a stay in intensive care unit before LT. Twelve (70%) needed a nutritional support (gastrostomy or jejunostomy) and 9 (53%) a tracheotomy in a context of swallowing disorders. All of patients alive presented an improvement after LT. The mean percentage of improvement of UWDRS was 61.2% (+/-22.2). According to the percentage of improvement 6 patients (35%) presented a major improvement (>70%), 5 patients a moderate improvement (30% to 70%) and 2 (12%) a mild improvement (<30%). Conclusion. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in Wilson disease for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with unfavorable evolution died of severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms and previous severe sepsis represent pejorative factors.

AB  - Background: Experience with Zinc in treating symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. Aim: To study the efficacy of Penicillamine followed by Zinc in treating symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analysed case records of 31 symptomatic hepatic WD patients in whom disease severity scores (Child's, MELD, Nazer's and nNew Wilson iIndex score) and 24-hour Urinary copper were compared at 3 three time points-baseline at presentation, at transition from Penicillamine to Zinc, and at end of follow-up. Results: Of the 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD studied, 10 had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was changed to Zinc sulfate either due to financial constraints (in 28 patients) or due to adverse effects of Penicillamine (in 3three). Child's grade was A in 6 six patients, B in 5 five, and C in 17 at presentation (baseline). Duration of initial Penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, median (range) and of subsequent Zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer's, nNew Wilson index, Child's and MELD score) at transition from Penicillamine to Zinc compared to with baseline. This improvement was maintained till end of study period. 17 Seventeen patients with Child C cirrhosis at presentation were treated with Penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks followed by Zinc for 344 (41-652) weeks, of whom 15 had significant improvement in liver function and disease severity scores until end of follow-up. 3 Three of 31 study patients died at 284, 112, and 437 weeks. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by Zinc maybe safe and effective treatment in resource constrained setting for symptomatic hepatic WD patients in all grades of baseline disease severity. Our data also suggests that some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease may be managed with medical treatment, avoiding liver transplantation.

AB  - Objective: To describe the clinical features of Wilson's disease patients followed at Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurologicas (INCN), Lima, Peru, between 1995 and 2013. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated to copper metabolism dysfunction due to mutation of ATP7B gene. WD presents with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, and ophthalmic and others manifestations. Neurological symptoms include parkinsonism, dystonia and ataxia. The clinical course is highly variable and diagnosis delay is not uncommon. Diagnosis of WD is based on clinical, biochemical and genetic analysis when available genetic features. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent or minimize permanent neurological complications. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients with clinical diagnosis of WD followed at INCN (Movement Disorders Unit and Neurogenetics Research Center). Demographic and clinical data as well as biochemical parameters (especially, serum ceruloplasmin and 24 hours urinary copper excretion); neuroimaging and specialized consultations were retrieved from clinical records. IRB Approval from local institution was obtained for this study. Results: Eight out of 19 patients identified were included in the study. 87.5 % (7) were males. Our WD patients presented with a mean age of 26 [17-44] years and a mean age at onset of 23.7 [12-44] years; the mean time from symptom onset to diagnostic was 20.3 [3-72] months. Parkinsonism was the predominant phenotype in this group, and together with dysarthria were the two most frequent symptoms at onset (37.5%). Kayser-Fleischer ring was confirmed in 62.5% (5) of the patients. The average serum ceruloplasmin concentration was 12.5 mg/dl [2.3-23.4] and average 24 hours urinary cooper excretion was 109.6 ug/24 horas [33.2-278]. The commonest finding on MRI brain was putamen signal changes (50%) followed by thalamus (37.5%). 87.5% (7) patients started treatment soon after the diagnosis and 75% (7) received therapy with penicillamine. Conclusions: This is the first case series on WD in Peruvian population. WD cases in our Peruvian cohort appear similar to the ones described in other populations; however diagnosis delay is higher than other reported worldwide.

AB  - Objective: To study the pattern of neurological worsening (NW) in patients undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WD is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment involves copper chelation and can reverse neurological disability and prevent disease-related mortality. However, some patients develop worsening of neurological signs during treatment. This can be drug-induced, or due to non-compliance, disease progression, intercurrent illnesses or emergent psychosis.a, b Methods: From 2005-2016 we prospectively recruited 120 consecutive patients visiting our Wilson's disease Clinic and tracked their neurological disability during treatment using Tier 2 of the Global Assessment Scale for Wilson disease (GAS for WD).b All received penicillamine (125-2000mg/day) except for 5 who were on trientine (300-1800mg/day). Results: Among the 120 patients (72 male; 48 female) we observed 64 instances of NW in 44 patients (30 male). The earliest signs of NW were irritability, or worsening of dysarthria, Wilson's facies or Kayser-Fleischer rings. Non-compliance with treatment was the commonest cause and was seen in 16 patients during the early intensive phase of copper chelation and in 18 patients during the maintenance phase. Most of these patients defaulted on treatment multiple times. Drug-induced NW was seen in 12 patients; 11 on penicillamine (mean dose 900mg; range 750-1750mg) and 1 on trientine (900mg). The time between initiation of treatment and NW varied widely (mean 2.8 months; range 0.5-14 months). In 10 patients such worsening was reversible over an average period of 1.2 months (range 0.5-4 months) with brief down-titration of the drug. However, in two it led to long term disability. NW due to disease progression was seen in four patients in the first few months of treatment initiation and improved with ongoing copper chelation. Emergent psychosis and intercurrent illnesses accounted for 11 and three cases of NW, respectively. These also improved with continued chelation. Conclusions: NW is seen over one-third of the patients undergoing treatment for WD with non-compliance being the most common cause. Monitoring neurological disability using GAS for WD scale enables one to detect such worsening, identify its cause, and respond appropriately (by encouraging compliance, down-titrating the dose, or continuing treatment course).

T2  - Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition
AB  - Objectives and study: Liver involvement in children with Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fibrosis. Pharmacological treatment is aimed to preserve liver function and improve patients' clinical condition. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens, France) has been already applied in many chronic liver diseases for non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis. We aimed to evaluate the change of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis and selected laboratory markers of liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease using Fibroscan. Methods: We included 33 children (19 females) with mean age of 11.5yrs with Wilson's disease, treated with either zinc or d-penicillamine. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded. At the baseline and after a mean period of 1.5 yrs all patients underwent Fibroscan examinations with medium (M) probe to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (Controlled Attenuation Parameter, CAP). Repeated laboratory liver function tests were performed at the same time. Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Results: At the baseline, our patients presented with slightly elevated liver enzymes ALT-49.5U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26U/I (19.5-35.5) and well preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial Fibroscan examination showed normal median liver stiffness 4.4kPa (M probe) (4.0-5.4) and slightly elevated liver steatosis CAP-257dB/m (235-283) [median, lower, upper quartile]. After a period of 1.5 years we found decrease, but not statistically significant, in ALT, AST and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than the baseline results (p=0.02). Similarly we have not observed marked difference in liver steatosis (CAP) or liver stiffness by Fibroscan when compared baseline and repeated measurements. Conclusion: 1. Liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis seem not to significantly improve in the short-term followup observation period of children with Wilson's disease, as based on the Fibroscan measurements. 2. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) can be easily used in children with Wilson's disease for monitoring of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis.

TI  - The first study of Wilson's disease prevalence in a Portuguese population
AU  - De Sousa, B. R. R. M.
AU  - Antunes, H.
T2  - Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition
AB  - Objectives and study: Wilson's Disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder responsible for an anomalous tissue deposition of copper. Global prevalence is estimated to be 1:40.000 although recent studies suggest possible underdiagnosis. There is an absence of studies regarding epidemiologic information of WD in Portugal. The primary goal of the study was estimating disease prevalence and incidence. Secondary goals focused on a descriptive analysis of the main clinical, pathological and biochemical characteristics of WD course in this population. Methods: Study design was retrospective, and included WD patients of all ages, observed between 1995 and 2015, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months and confirmed to have been born in the Northern region of Portugal. Patients were identified through the use of the Portuguese National Health Service's clinical coding system based on clinical data of thirteen Portuguese hospitals, liver biopsy histological assessment and hospital prescription records. Statistical analysis was conducted to establish potential clinical-analytical correlations through chi square, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Results: We identified and collected clinical data on 94 WD patients, six of which were deceased. Prevalence of WD in the past 20 years was 1:37.000 with a current prevalence of 1 per 45.000 inhabitants and an incidence of 1 per million people/year. A pediatric age of presentation occurred in 55,8% with a median age at diagnosis of 16,6 years (12,3-20,8) and male gender in 53,2%. Average follow-up was 15,2+/-8,8 years. Predominant liver disease was the most common form of presentation in 54,8%, with 37,0% of these presenting with cirrhosis; mixed neurological/hepatic symptoms in 17,9% and predominant neurological presentation in 10,7%. Neurological symptoms were associated with a later disease onset (p=0,001) and higher presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (p<0,001), detected in 27,0% of all patients. Liver transplant was accomplished in 23,9%. Regarding therapy, penicillamine was the most frequently used, with adverse reactions observed in 24,8% and trientine was used in 41,0% patients at some moment of the disease. A significant reduction in hepatic liver enzymes was observed 6 and 12 months after starting therapy (AST: p=0,002; ALT:p=0,002), which was not observed in urinary copper excretion. Conclusion: This study constitutes a step further in a better comprehension of epidemiological, clinical and disease management of WD in the Northern Portuguese region, which appears similiar to previously published works in other countries. Since more than half of WD patients were diagnosed at a paediatric age, efforts should be focused on development of tools directed to the establishment of an early diagnosis for a better disease management.

T2  - Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand
AB  - Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. Clinical presentations are extraordinarily diverse, and currently no single diagnostic test can confirm WD with high accuracy. A complete understanding of the presentations and improved diagnostic methods are important for disease management. The authors' aimed to examine disease characteristics, management, and treatment outcome of WD in children, especially when genetic analysis and liver copper measurements were limited. Material and Method: Data was collected from 21 WD children who were treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Inclusion criteria followed the WD scoring system, where other liver diseases are ruled out systematically. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 13.5+/-3.36 years, with 19 symptomatic patients, and two asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed through family screening. Presentations varied, jaundice (52%), ascites (52%), edema (52%), Coombsnegative hemolytic anemia (14%), neurological abnormalities (33%), renal involvement (19%), and fulminant hepatic failure (5%). Based on the key parameters in WD scoring system, 14 patients (66%) had Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. Seventeen (89%) had low serum ceruloplasmin, and 20 (95%) had increased urinary copper excretion. These positive findings made WD scoring system accurately diagnose 66% of patients. Chelation therapy was the first line of therapy for all patients except one, who underwent liver transplantation. After therapy, liver function test returned to normal in all patients. However, neurological symptoms did not improve with combined drug therapy using chelating and neuropsychiatric agents. Conclusion: WD in children mostly affected the liver. WD was suspected in seven patients (34%), thus needed further investigation. Therefore, long-term follow-up in those with suspected WD is the appropriate method for diagnosis and management in limited diagnostic tests. We suggest further treatment, and use of clinical response to treatment, as a criterion for confirming the WD diagnosis. Copyright Â© 2016, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.

AU  - Tai, C. S.
AU  - Ni, Y. H.
T2  - Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, the preference of medication, and the long-term outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Methods: Data was obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores detailed clinical records of all insurers in Taiwan. The database used in this study is a randomized sample of twomillion out of 23million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. And the integrated medical records of these two-million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson's disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in either outpatient clinic or inpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual incidence rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The age-specific incidence rate peaked at 10-14 years of age, followed by 20-24 years, and 25-29 years. 54 of all subjects (81.8%) started the treatment with D-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases with Wilson's disease, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and 3 (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. Conclusions: D-penicillamine is still the drug most prescribed for patients with Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a favorable long-term outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study. Liver failure or mortality was rarely found.

T2  - Pediatric Nephrology
AB  - a. Objectives Since the diverse manifestations of renal impairment appear in different periods of Wilson's disease(WD), misdiagnosis is not rare. We carried out this study to find the clinical features of renal impairment in children with WD. b. Methods We enrolled 102 children with WD who had been treated at our department from January 1995 to December 2012. Renal impairment is enclosed one of followings: abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria1/4hematuria,glucosuria, hypercalcinuria or increase of urine NAG; abnormal renal function (BUN>=7.14 mmol/L, Scr>=176.8 mol/L); abnormal renal ultrasound or kidney biopsy; excluding renal involvement caused by other factors. c. Results Demographic data: There are 58 with abnormal urine analysis in 102 WD patients. Excluded 14 with only once and 10 with D-penicillamine treatment, the remaining 34 patients: 14 boys and 20 girls.The disease course ranged from 3 days to 10 years. Clinical presentations:14 had hematuria, 4 had proteinuria and 15 had both proteinuria and hematuria,2 cases were nephrotic proteinuria, 1 case was renal tubular acidosis. Urine NAG increased in 12, urine RBC phase morphology was detected in 15, 3 glomerular hematuria and 12 non-glomerular. 1 patient's urine calcium increased. Serum creatinine clearance rate decreased in 2 patients. Bultrasound revealed asystematic kidney damages in 5 of 27 patients. Kidney biopsy showed IgA deposit in mesangial region in 2. Initial renal impairment:9 had initiated symptoms of renal impairment, 4 of them had gross hematuria, 1 with edema, hematuria and proteinuria,1 with purpura, hematuria and proteinuria,1 with frequent and urgent urination, 2 with edema and severe proteinuria. Prognosis:All patients' renal impairment were improved or disappeared after treatment. d. Conclusions Renal impairment with WD, including injury after D-penicillamine treatment are not rare. Themanifestations of renal impairment with WD are varied. Early diagnosis may bring them better prognosis. 10 - Glomerulonephritis, lupus, vasculitis.

AB  - Background and aims: In the literature, estimated Wilson disease (WD) prevalence varies between 1/30,000 and 1/100,000. In France, with a population of 64 million inhabitants, one would expect between 640 and 2100 cases of WD. Objectives of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of WD based on data from the French national health insurance information system (SNIIRAM) and to analyse epidemiological data according to age, gender and treatments. Methods: This study concerned all beneficiaries covered by the general health insurance scheme representing 90% of the French population. WD patients were identified on the existence of long term illness eligible for 100% reimbursement of health (affection longue duree (ALD)) with E83.0 code (copper metabolism disorder) or on at least one hospitalization between 2011 and 2013 with the same code. Results: 906 WD patients were identified, that is prevalence of 1.5/100,000. However, it is certainly underestimated because patients stabilized for many years are not registered as ALD. 43.2% were under 40 years old. Almost 40% of the patients were treated by D-Penicillamine and 14.3% by Zinc acetate, 5.6% received neuroleptics, 15% antidepressants. 5.3% had liver transplantation. Triethylenetetramine, delivered as compassionate, doesn't appear in the base. Comparison of these data with the 500 patients followed in the national reference centre for WD will be presented. Conclusion: This is the first French population-based epidemiologic study of WD concerning an exhaustive population, an important step to understand the public health impact of WD and to further study quality of care.

AB  - Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism in which metal deposits cause dysfunctions of various organs, mostly the liver and brain. If untreated, WD is fatal, but early treatment results in a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome has not yet been clarified. To address this issue, we evaluated the neurological status of early-treated WD patients without overt nervous system impairment using neurophysiological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging procedures at least 10 years after treatment onset. Methods: Thirty-eight WD patients (18 females and 20 males, aged 24.47 +/- 7.50 years), who received an early diagnosis in presymptomatic or mild or moderate liver disease stages without neurological involvement and prompt treatment, were clinically evaluated with the Global Assessment Scale. Presentation was hepatic in 36 subjects (95%), while 2 patients (5%) were diagnosed in a presymptomatic stage. A neurophysiological study was performed to explore the central motor conduction time of the upper and lower limbs, and motor cortex excitability using single pulses and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neuroimages were obtained with brain magnetic resonance scans. Cognitive abilities, and psychiatric and behavioral disturbances were evaluated with neuropsychological tests. TMS studies were also performed in a separate group of 15 WD patients with neurologic signs (8 males and seven females; mean age 28.2 +/- 12.1 years, mean treatment duration 15.8 +/-9.14 years). Fifteen age-, education-, and sex-matched healthy subjects, not affected by any neurological, psychiatric or other relevant clinical conditions (10 females and five males; mean age 26.7 +/- 9.1 years; years of schooling 13.2 +/- 2. 4) served as the control group for clinical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric evaluation. Results: Patients were undergoing treatment with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good adherence. They did not present any neurological signs at clinical evaluation or at specific scale of impairment, the mean Global Assessment Scale score was 0.3+/-0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric assessment ruled out subclinical involvement. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of WD can prevent the onset of neurologic damage, even at subclinical level.

AB  - Objectives and study: Wilson's disease in childhood may present with mild or significant liver injury as indicated by liver biopsy and liver function tests. Zinc or D-penicillamine (D-pen) seem to stop progression of liver damage but zinc effectivity is often questioned. As liver biopsy is not usually repeated in the course of the disease only surrogate markers can be used for assessment of liver disease. Recently non-invasive transient elastography - Fibroscan (Echosens, France) has been applied in many chronic liver diseases for assessment of fibrosis and steatosis. We aimed to evaluate progression of liver disease and response to treatment assessed by Fibroscan in relationship to the extent and type of liver damage before treatment as assessed by liver histology and liver function tests. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed liver histology, liver copper content and biochemical markers of 34 children with Wilson's disease aged 12.8+/-4.1 years at the time of diagnosis and compared them to liver stiffness (LSM) and steatosis (CAP) using Fibroscan after mean period of 9.7yrs of treatment with zinc (n=21) or D-pen (n=13). In addition LSM and CAP results of pts with Wilson's disease were compared to a control group of 20 healthy controls aged 11.8+/-5.3yrs. Liver histology was described semiquantitatively including micro- and macrovesicular steatosis (modified NAFLD scoring system by Kleiner et al.), portal and lobular inflammation and cholestasis. The associations were tested with Spearman R test and differences between groups were tested with Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The selected cohort of patients with Wilson's disease presented with variable fibrosis (grade 3-4 in 13 patients), lobular inflammation (grade 2-3 in 2 pts), portal inflammation (grade 2-3 in 3 pts), microvesicular (grade 2-3 in 3pts) and macrovesicular steatosis (grade 2-3 in 12pts) and without cholestasis. There were no differences in pre-treatment parametres between children treated with Zn and D-pen. Liver fibrosis (LSM) assessed by Fibroscan was slightly but significantly higher in pts with Wilson's disease than in healthy controls [5 (4.1-6.1) vs. 4.2 (3.8-4.5) kPa] and steatosis expressed by CAP was also increased [252 (218-292) vs. 182 (119-194) dB/m]; p<0.05. We found a significant relationship between liver steatosis assessed by Fibroscan (CAP) and macrovesicular liver steatosis on liver biopsy (r=0.68) while LSM was not related to liver fibrosis. LSM significantly correlated with baseline total bilirubin levels (r=0,4) but not with other liver function tests, ceruloplasmin or liver copper content. We found no difference in Fibroscan results between groups treated with D-pen or zinc [LSM 5.4 (4.3-6.1) vs 4.5 (4.1-5.8) kPa; CAP 251 (208-266) vs. 256 (235- 307) dB/m]. Conclusion: Liver steatosis in children with Wilson's disease seems not to respond to treatment and the extent of steatosis in the course of the disease is closely related to pre-treatment values. Fibrosis at start of therapy is affected by treatment and may change significantly with time. D-pen and Zn therapy seem to be equally effective when tested with Fibroscan in children with mild liver injury.

AB  - Background/Aims: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism in which copper accumulates in the organ, particularly in the liver and the central nervous system. As a rare disease, population-based epidemiology of WD is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the nationwide, population-based prevalence, comorbidity, treatment regimen, and direct medical cost of WD in South Korea from 2009 to 2013. Methods: Using 2 big data source from Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) claims database and Rare Intractable Diseases registration program database from 2009 to 2013 in Korea, we identified all patients with WD registered by physician as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code for WD (E83.0), and with the registration record (V174) for the rare disease in Korea. The five-year data included 1,509 patients linked with information including age, gender, comorbidity ICD-10 codes, prescribed medications, and direct medical costs. Results: The overall crude prevalence of WD was 2.38/100,000 people and it showed increasing tendency during the 5 years (2.27, 2.28, 2.35, 2.45, and 2.53/100,000 at 2009-2013, respectively). Most (72%) patients were diagnosed before 30 years old, and 1.4% had additional disease code for neurologic/ psychologic disease. Liver cirrhosis and liver cancer were detected in 33.2% and 9.9%, respectively. Liver transplantation was performed in 4.6% of patients. D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc were prescribed for 58.3%, 29.7%, and 13.9% of patients, respectively. Mean annual total medical cost per person for WD was 1,643.15 USD. Conclusion: The prevalence of WD was slightly lower in Korean than other countries, showing an increase from 2009. Since about one third of WD patients had advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis and cancer, more efforts for early diagnosis and treatment for WD are warranted, especially during pediatric age.

AB  - Objective:The aim of our study was to analyze the frequency of early neurological worsening in WD patients, its outcome, clinical and laboratory factors which may impact it. Background: Early neurological worsening during initiation of Wilson's Disease (WD)treatment is still an unresolved therapeutic problem. Methods: We analyzed 143 symptomatic WD patients, diagnosed between 2005-2010. The early neurological deterioration group was based on worsening in Unified Wilson's Disease Score Scale (UWDRS) scored at baseline till 6 months or occurrence of new neurological symptoms. Reversibility of worsening was followedup to 24 months. Further the analysis were performed in subgroups with and without neurological worsening according to selected clinical and laboratory variables and type of anticopper therapy. Results: Early neurological worsening in 11.1 [percnt](16/143)of WD patients, only in patients with neurological signs at diagnosis.The mean time of worsening since WD treatment began was 2,3+/-1.9 months.The neurological deterioration was completely reversible in 53[percnt](8/15)and partially in 13[percnt] (2/15) patients during 9.2+/-5.2 months.The gender, age of diagnosis, disease duration, kind of WD treatment(Dpenicillamine or zinc sulphate),kind of neurological manifestations, initial copper metabolism results as well as liver functions parameters had no impact on early neurological worsening. Baseline neurological symptoms (15/69 vs.0/73;p<0.01);advance of neurological deficits scored in UWDRS part II and III(p<0.01); the occurrence of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes due to WD in thalamus(p<0.01)and brain stem(p<0.01); the concomitant treatment with drugs potentially modulating the action of dopamine (p<0.05),were the main predictors of early neurological deterioration in WD patients. Conclusions: Neurological worsening at the beginning of the anticopper therapy in WD patients occur in patients with severe initial neurological manifestation, advanced brain injury and may be also provoked by concomitant treatment, but it is not associated with the type of anticopper therapy.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate how effective zinc therapy can reverse parkinsonism in Wilson's disease patients who were initially treated with penicillamine. Background: For years, the treatment of Wilson's disease has been aiming at stimulating the excretion of accumulated copper by chelating agents. The dilemma arises when patients paradoxically deteriorate, which is because chelators increase free copper levels. Conversely, zinc therapy normalizes the raised serum and urine free copper by inducing metallothionein production. Methods: In a retrospective observational study on four Wilson's disease patients with severe parkinsonism being initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared the subjective and objective clinical improvement before and one year after shifting to zinc monotherapy. Global Assessment Scale (GAS) was used for clinical evaluations. Global disability were measured in four domains: liver, cognition and behavior, motor, and osseomuscular, and the neurological dysfunction were assessed in 14 main categories. Results: Three of the four patients who had been deteriorated on penicillamine (0.5-1 g/d), have improved significantly to a normal biochemical and clinical state on zinc (150 mg/d). The fourth patient on 250 mg/d penicillamine plus 200 mg/d zinc slightly improved in lower extremities after one month, while she considerably improved to a symptom-free state in the following months on zinc monotherapy. Their global disability improved by about 73%, and neurological assessments revealed a 100% amelioration. Conclusions: The results suggest zinc monotherapy as the safe and promising treatment for copper intoxication, and support normalizing the increased serum and urine copper values as a rational therapeutic strategy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tostudy the neurological outcomes of Wilson disease (WD) following decoppering.BACKGROUND: Judicious decoppering can prevent WD related mortality and reverse neurological disability. DESIGN/METHODS: From 2005-2013 we prospectively recruited 100 consecutive patients with WD and WD related neurological disability. All received, penicillamine or trientine in recommmended doses (125 mg/day - up to 2 gm/day), in the initial decoppering phase of treatment. Treatment was tracked by using the standard WD specific scale, the Global Assessment Scale of Wilson Disease (GAS for WD).RESULTS: There was no mortality over the eight year study period. Of the 100 patients, 56 were men. The mean age at disease onset was 12.4 years (range 3-35). As per the three point disease severity scale (SS3), on recruitment, 43 % patients had severe neurological disability (defined as being bedbound, mute, requiring enteral feeding & bladder catheterization). While 37% had moderate and, 20% had mild neurological disability. Dystonia was the most frequent movement disorder (77%) followedby parkinsonism (53%) and tremor (47%). Of the 100 patients, 4 were lost to follow up after the initial visit and two were refractory to decoppering. All of the other 94 patients showed significant neurological recovery over a mean follow up of 20.7 months (range 4-36). Seventy per cent of the 94 patients (including 68% of patients with severe neurologic disability) showed complete neurological recovery and could resume normal lives at par with their peers. At last follow up, 30 % of the 94 patients exhibit on-going recovery. Promisingly, improvements were also seen in various movements disorders including dystonia and parkinsonism. Adverse events observed included, transient decoppering induced neurological deterioration (n=15), thrombocytopenia (n=20), emergent psychosis (n=10), skin rash (n=6), non-traumatic fracture (n=4), and penicillamine induced lupus (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Our report reinforces that remarkable neurological recovery can be expected in patients with WD with judicious decoppering. Objective clinical assessments help in monitoring treatment and tracking resolution of disability.

AB  - Introduction: Under treatment or not, the course of pregnancy in patients with Wilson's disease and drug safety in lactation are issues not well understood. Materyal and Methods : In this study, 194 patients (156 index cases) in Istanbul Faculty of Medicine with a follow-up of median 51 months (13-105 months) and 1069 patient-years were evaluated retrospectively for pregnancy. All patients met EASL 2012 Wilson's disease guideline's criteria. Results: 20 (16 index cases) out of 84 women had a total of 49 pregnancies. On presentation, 7 patients had decompensated cirrhosis, 4 had compensated cirrhosis, 6 had neurological signs (dysarthria, tremor etc.) and 9 were in precirrhotic stage. Out of 16 pre diagnosis pregnancies, 9 resulted in spontaneous abortion. Out of 33 post diagnosis pregnancies, 5 resulted in spontaneous abortion and 5 underwent termination (one due to fetal anomaly and 4 on patients' request). Out of 23 live births, one was born premature and died in three weeks. No anomalies were reported in the other 22 and they are still alive and healthy. One patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and Wilson's disease after 7 abortions. Under treatment, she had a live birth following two miscarriages. One of the patients who discontinued her medication during pregnancy died in the second month postpartum due to liver failure. The other patient developed tremor in the third trimester and her treatment was started again. Drug doses were reduced during pregnancy; one patient was treated with zinc (100mg/d), one was treated with 600 mg of trientine plus 100 mg of zinc and others were treated with D-penicillamine 600 mg/d and zinc 100 mg/ d. Copper deficiency did not develop in any of the pregnancies. The patients breastfed their babies. After lactation, drug doses were increased when needed. No wound healing problems occurred after the c-section of 10 patients who were under D-penicillamine (600 mg/d) treatment. Conclusion : Wilson's patients can get pregnant under combination therapy (chelator and zinc) even if they present with decompansated cirrhosis. During pregnancy, drugs should be administered twice daily (D-penicillamine 600 mg/d, trientine 600 mg/d, zinc 100 mg/d) and treatments should never be discontinued. At given doses, D-penicillamine does not impair wound healing after c-section. No complications occurred when treatment was continued during lactation as long as the mother was thoroughly informed, but further studies are needed to better understand the subject.

AB  - Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms associated with positive copper balance. It is possible to improve survival and quality of life with chelation therapy, even during a decompensated stage. Material and methods: In this single-center study, we shared the 20-year experience with regards to diagnosis and treatment of 194 cases (156 indices) diagnosed according to EASL 2012 Wilson's disease criteria. Patients presenting with acute liver failure were excluded and all possible causes of liver disease were investigated. Results: 56.7 % (110) of all patients were male, with a mean age of 22.3 +/- 10 years at the time of diagnosis, with a delay in diagnosis of 19 +/- 33 (0-168) months. 35.7 % of all patients had hepatic form, 20.7 % had neurological form and 28.9 % had hepatoneurologic form. 14.7 % of patients were asymptomatic. Screening family members revealed 38 patients, out of which, 24 % had compensated liver cirrhosis and 39.5 % had normal findings. HBsAg positivity was 3.1 %, Anti-HCV 0.5 %, respectively. Patients had low serum ceruloplasmin levels (<20 mg /dL) 86 %, elevated 24-h urine copper output (> 100 mcg) 89.9 % and elevated hepatic copper (> 250 mcg / g) 84.7 %. During the course of treatment, ceruloplasmin levels decreased in 89 % of the patients and were below the diagnostic cutoff (p <0.05). More common in patients with neurological signs, 65.7 % had Kayser Fleischer ring. Serum albumin levels increased, transaminase levels decreased, prothrombin time shortened and clinical ascites disappeared significantly with treatment. Four people with drug noncompliance developed neurological symptoms. 10 patients had their D-penicillamine treatment switched to trientine due to increased neurological symptoms. During follow-up we lost 15 patients due to drug noncompliance; one patient due to duodenal variceal bleeding, and one patient due to sepsis (D-penicillamine treatment increased transfer dysphagia and caused aspiration pneumonia) 315 siblings of 93 index cases were screened. Secondary tests were ordered in 89 cases because a diagnostic criterion was met. The parents of 46.4 % had intra-familial marriages. Conclusion: Multiple copper metabolism markers should be used in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, and family members must be tested. With the right treatment, prognosis is excellent.

AB  - Purpose: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder (1:30,000) of the ATP7B gene that results in copper accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea and kidney. Even though there are available treatment options such as low-copper diets, zinc acetate, tetrathiomolybdate and copper chelation, patients may still present in crisis either before their disease is diagnosed, or after diagnosis due to ineffectiveness or intolerance to current therapy. Patients with Wilson's disease crisis often present with fulminant hepatic failure, severe DAT-negative hemolytic anemia and multiorgan failure, with rapid clinical deterioration. Eventually many patients require liver transplantation. In this setting, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been used to remove copper and provide a bridge to liver transplantation. Most studies describing the use plasma exchange for Wilson's disease have been case reports. Here we report the collective experiences through the ASFA apheresis registry on Wilson's disease. Methods: The ASFA apheresis registry study is a multicenter registry study. Both prospective and retrospective data with the latter involving data collection back to January 2000 are allowed in the registry. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Children's National Health System. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The registry includes patient demographic and clinical information, apheresis procedural information, treatment schedule, and treatment outcome/complications. All participating sites had obtained approval from the ASFA apheresis registry subcommittee of the ASFA Applications committee as well as from local IRBs. Results: To date, a total of 10 patients (three males and seven females) with Wilson's disease treated between 2005 and 2013 were included in this study. Median age of first diagnosis was 16- years-old (range 6-30 years). Median age at first TPE was 17 years (range 6-61 years). The patients underwent a total of 43 TPEs with most of patients requiring an intensive session of TPE. Median number of TPE procedures was 3.5 (range 1-9). Other than one patient who had received one TPE before the patient was transferred to the study site, no patient received TPE prior to the first registry study TPE. All of the TPEs used ACD-A as anticoagulation, 98% (42/43) TPEs targeted 1-1.25 plasma volumes, and 95% (41/43) TPEs were performed with 100% fluid balance. All patients had a central line placed for TPE. Post TPE, 90% (9/ 10) patients underwent liver transplantation, all 10 patients (transplanted as well no transplanted) have at least a 6-month survival. Conclusion: All 10 patients with Wilson's disease who underwent plasma exchange had a positive outcome in terms of 6- month survival. As a first report of the ASFA apheresis registry study, we demonstrated the value of using this registry to collect apheresis related patient outcome from multiple centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large cohorts. We assessed the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and outcomes of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria, and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurologic and hepatic symptoms and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier estimation; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 y after therapy began). RESULTS: Changes in medication were common, resulting in analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were more frequent among those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight months after therapy, hepatic deterioration was reported in only 4 of 333 patients treated initially with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90%, and neurologic improvements were observed in more than 55%, of therapy-naive patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurologic deterioration was observed less frequently in patients given D-penicillamine first (6 of 295) than those given trientine first (4 of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable outcomes, although D-penicillamine had a higher rate of adverse events. Few patients receiving chelation therapy had neurologic deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine. Â© 2013 AGA Institute.

AB  - Treatment of Wilson disease is based on the use of copper chelators to promote copper excretion from the body, or use of zinc to reduce copper absorption in the ileum. Here we report the utility of zinc acetate therapy for Wilson disease in children. Fifteen patients including 6 males and 9 females, were treated with zinc acetate. Before treatment, nothing was given to 6 patients, 5 were treated with penicillamine, and 4 were with trientine. Median levels of liver function measured at zero months, 6 months, and 1 year were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase 48, 35, and 33 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase 71, 25, and 46 IU/l; mu-glutamyltranspeptidase 49, 46, and 55 IU/l. The median value of spot urinary copper was 1112 mug/l (0.15 mug/mg/creatinine) with the use of a chelator, and 141 mug/l (0.10 mug/mg/creatinine) without the use of a chelator. Three patients experienced nausea, and one experienced oral cavity discomfort. This study shows that zinc acetate therapy is an effective treatment for childhood onset of Wilson disease.

AB  - Thirty three prospectively enrolled cases of Hepatic Wilson's disease were given D-Pencillamine (10-20mg/kg/day) and zinc therapy. Combination therapy (administered at intervals to avoid interference) was shifted to zinc only therapy after the normalization of transaminases. Normal transaminases and negative copper balance at 12 months on therapy were considered successful therapy. Time of clinical and biochemical response (AST & ALT <60 IU/L) were calculated. Thirty three cases (median age of 127.21+/- 42.27 months) were enrolled. Liver transplantation (LT) was offered to 5 cases with fulminant hepatic failure. Of the rest 28 cases with chronic liver disease (CLD): 4 of the 5 presenting as acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 3 of the 17 decompensated CLD required LT. All 6 compensated CLD, 1 of 5 ACLF and 14 of 17 with decompensated CLD were successfully treated with medical therapy. Twenty one (75%) of the 28 cases successfully treated on medical therapy. Twenty cases showed clinical response within 6 months and 1 case at 12 months. Fifteen cases showed biochemical response within 6 months and remaining 6 cases by 12 months. Conclusions: 75% cases improved on combination therapy with response within 6 months.

AB  - Background/aims: Wilson's disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder with defective biliary excretion of copper leading to its accumulation in the liver and brain. We report the clinical features, treatment and outcome of WD patients in our center. Methods: All WD patients (n = 35) referred to our center from 2000 to 2012 were studied retrospectively. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 16 years [range = 8-59] with 60 % females. Five (14.3 %) gave positive history of parental consanguinity. Thirty one (88.6 %) of the patients presented with hepatic involvement only and 4 (11.4 %) had mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement. Nine (25.7 %) were fulminant WD, 14 (40 %) chronic WD with hepatic decompensation and 12 (34.3 %) without hepatic decompensation. All patients had serum ceruloplasmin below 0.2 g/L [median = 0.12 g/L, range =<0.06-0.24], 27 (77.1 %) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 25 (83.3 %) had urinary copper excretion above 1.6 umol/day [median = 6.34 umol/day, range = 1.71-65.07]. The first line treatments were penicillamine monotherapy (54.3 %), penicillamine plus zinc (42.9 %) and one (2.8 %) did not receive any treatment because she died soon after admission. Thirteen (38.2 %) of the penicillamine patients developed complications namely haematuria (n = 2), proteinuria (n = 1), haematological (n = 1), IgA nephropathy (n = 1), hyperprolactinaemia (n = 1), myasthenia gravis (n = 1), breast gigantism (n = 1), mucositis (n = 1), anaemia (n = 1) and rashes (n = 4). Thirteen patients had change in medications to trientine (n = 6), zinc (n = 3), trientine plus zinc (n = 2) and penicillamine plus zinc (n = 2). One patient received liver transplantation because of poor response to penicillamine therapy. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months (0.06-132). At the end of follow-up, 37.1 % died and the mortality rate in fulminant WD was 77.8 %. Conclusions: WD in our population affects more females, diagnosed at young age and mainly chronic WD with hepatic decompensation. All patients had low ceruloplasmin and high proportion had Kayser- Fleischer rings. Intolerance to penicillamine occurred in 38.2 %. The mortality rate was 37.1 %.

AB  - Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder characterized by copper accumulation mainly in the liver. The treatment is based on chelators, and/or zinc. Efficacy of monotherapy with zinc has been questioned by Weiss et al. [1]. Aim: to evaluate reasons for treatment changes in WD patients diagnosed in childhood. Methods: 44 patients with WD, referred to our Department of Pediatrics (1984-2012), were analyzed. 42 had hepatic presentation and 2 were recruited for family screening. For each patient, the type of treatment carried out was classified in: d-penicillamine; zinc salts; combination of d-penicillamine and zinc. Reasons for therapy changes were: treatment failure, adverse events, patient demand (not linked to adverse events) and maintenance regimen. Weexcluded from our analysis, discontinuation of treatment linked to shift to maintenance therapy.Wecalculated the duration of each block of treatment until a change of medication or until the end of the follow-up period. We analyzed events of treatment changes using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: 44 (31 males, median age at diagnosis = 5.9 years, range = 1-16.9) of the 48 evaluated patients, were selected for treatment analysis. Changes in medical treatment were common events resulting in a total of 79 treatment blocks (32 penicillamine therapy, 35 zinc therapy and 12 combination therapy). Of these, 76 (31 penicillamine therapy, 34 zinc therapy and 11 combination therapy) were suitable for analysis. A change in medication due to treatment failure or adverse events, not linked to the transition to maintenance therapy, was observed in 4 of 34 zinc blocks (12%), 13 of 31 penicillamine blocks (42%) and 4 of 11 combination blocks (36%). Discontinuation due to adverse events was most common in patients receiving penicillamine with 6 (5 penicillamine, 1 combination) of 42 block treatments stopped for this reason. A change in medication due to treatment failure was observed in 16 blocks of 76 (21%): 8 of 31 penicillamine treatments (26%), in 4 of 34 zinc blocks (12%) and 4 of 11 combination blocks (36%). This reached statistical significance comparing zinc versus combination therapy, but not zinc with penicillamine. Among treatment failure blocks, noncompliance to therapy was pointed out in 1 of 8 pencillamine treatments (12%), 2 of 4 zinc (12%) and 4 of 4 combination treatments (100%). Conclusion: Therapy discontinuation for treatment failure and/or adverse events was more common on penicillamine than on zinc. Differently from Weiss data (1), our study confirmed that zinc monotherapy is effective in controlling liver disease in patients with WD, diagnosed and treated since childhood.

AB  - Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a treatable inherited copper metabolism disorder. However, there is no international consensus about the first-line therapy. Objective: Our aim was to compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic WD that started d-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as a drug of choice. Patients and methods: We included 143 consecutive, new diagnosed patients with symptomatic WD between 2005 and 2009. The decision about the first-line therapy drugwas made at the physician's discretion. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neuropsychiatric and hepaticWD. Results: Neurological and enzymatic improvements were achieved with similar frequency. In patients with neuropsychiatric WD, the probability of remaining on first-line therapy was similar for DPA and ZS (20% vs. 24% at the end of follow-up). In patients with hepatic WD, it was significantly higher for ZS (31% vs. 12%). After adjusting for type of WD, sex, age at diagnosis, and the presence of at least severe hepatic symptoms, patients treated with DPA were more likely to experience worsening (OR 3.84, 95% CI: 1.15-3.85) during the first 6 months of treatment. Patients on DPA were significantly more compliant (94% vs. 81%), but experienced more adverse effects (15% vs. 3%). Conclusions: DPA and ZS are effective in the majority of WD patients. Despite certain differences, none of them appears clearly superior. Therefore, ZS may be considered a reasonable alternative to DPA as a first-line therapy.

AU  - Hoogenraad, T. U.
T2  - Movement Disorders
AB  - Objective: To compare clinical improvement in Wilson's disease patients (1) following normalization of high serum and urine free copper rather than excretion of copper accumulation and (2) on zinc therapy, with and without penicillamine. Background: For years the treatment of Wilson's disease has been aiming at stimulating the excretion of accumulated copper by chelating agents. However, the dilemma arises when patients paradoxically deteriorate on them. Zinc, on the other hand, is usually downplayed by being restricted to maintenance, or concomitant therapy. Chelators increase the free copper levels in serum and urine, while zinc normalizes the values by interrupting intestinal copper absorption. Methods: In a retrospective observational study on four Wilson's disease patients with parkinsonism being initially treated on penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared the subjective and objective clinical improvement before and after shifting to zinc monotherapy. Results: Three of the four patients being deteriorated on penicillamine (0.5-1 gram per day), improved significantly to a normal biochemical and clinical state on zinc (150 milligram per day). The fourth patient on penicillamine (250 milligram per day) plus zinc (200 milligram per day) improved in lower extremities during the first month, while she considerably improved on zinc monotherapy in the following months. Conclusions: The results of the four patients suggest zinc as a promising, safe and affordable treatment for patients with copper intoxication, and neurological Wilson's disease. Moreover, they support the rational idea of normalization of increased serum and urine copper values rather than stimulating the excretion of accumulated copper that induces free copper intoxication.

AB  - Objective: Aim of this study is to assess the impact on nervous system of Wilson disease (WD) in early treated (ET) patients with long duration of disease. Background: During the course of WD neurological disorders (ND) have been described frequently especially when treatment is delayed. In the last years most of WD cases have been diagnosed in childhood at the occurrence of hypertransaminasemia (HT) receiving an early treatment and apparently not showing a progression of the disease afterwards. Methods: A clinical, neurophysiologycal and neuroradiological assessment has been conducted in patients with WD with long duration of disease and therapy. Clinical neurological evaluation was performed using the neurological section of "global assessment scale" (GAS) for WD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed to study the central conduction time and cortical excitability with the paired pulse technique exploring short interval cortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation. A brain MRI scan was performed for each patient. Results: 27 patients (16 M, age range 13-47 y) with a mean disease duration of 16.5 years (range 7-28) have been assessed from 2011 to 2012. All patients started treatment soon after the diagnosis and currently are on pennicillamine (6 patients) or zinc acetate (21 patients). TMS and brain MRI studies were normal in 23 subjects who received diagnosis of WD for the occurrence of HT in childhood and never reported ND. The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed in adolescence presenting ND as onset, only 2 of them still show neurological signs (GAS 16-18) but all have brain MRI alterations while TMS findings are normal. Conclusions: During the recent decades WD natural history seems to be changed as nervous system could be not affected when patients are diagnosed in childhood receiving early treatment (Ala A 2007). Our study confirms that ET patients, not presenting ND at the onset, do not show neurological clinical signs even after a long disease duration. The normality of TMS and brain MRI studies also suggests the absence of sublicnical nervous system impairment.

AB  - Background and objectives: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Our objective was to describe the diverse patterns, therapies, and outcomes of this disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study over two decades on WD patients in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia. Patients and Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were retrieved from their charts, referral notes and our hospital electronic records and were analyzed. Results: The mean age and standard deviation was 16.8 (10.7) years and 56.5% were males. The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological, and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%), and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) were asymptomatic cases detected by family screening. A family history of WD was positive in 41 (57.7%) patients, and consanguinity of parents was found in 26 (36.6%) patients. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 92.2 (72.9) (range, 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow up, while 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%) were still on or lost from follow-up, respectively. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow- up was 25.3 (12) (range, 4-62) years. Hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7.0%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58 (81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientine were given to 32 (45.1%) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation and one died (1.4%) on the waiting list. The liver condition remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%), and the neurological status showed improvement in 11 (34.4%) of the 32 patients who had neurological involvement. Conclusions: This is the biggest cohort to be reported from the Middle East. WD presentation and outcome of WD are very diverse, and its diagnosis still depends on clinical, laboratory, and radiological evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. WD should be considered in patients of any age with obscure hepatic and/or neurological abnormalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To describe the authors' clinical experience with a cohort of 48 adult patients followed in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosis of WD was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine charts were identified and 11 were excluded on further review. At diagnosis, 14 patients were asymptomatic, with 13 hepatic, 15 neurological and six mixed hepatic/neurological presentations. Ceruloplasmin levels were low (<0.20 g/L) in 94%, and 24 h urinary copper levels high (>0.60 mumol/L) in 95% of cases. D-penicillamine was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc the most common at review (65%). Overall, biopsy and ultrasound reports documented cirrhosis in 53%. Portal hypertension, defined as splenomegaly (>12.0 cm), reversed portal venous flow on ultrasound or varices/gastropathy on endoscopy was seen in 63%. At last review, 39% had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (>34 U/L) and/or alanine aminotransferase levels (>40 U/L). One death and one transplant occurred, while three patients had encephalopathy, two became jaundiced, two developed ascites and one experienced variceal bleed. Of 21 neurological presenting patients, 14 improved compared with baseline, with four making almost complete recovery. Eleven patients experienced documented episodes of neurological decline, including four with non-neurological presentation. Diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging showed basal ganglia (64%), brainstem (64%) abnormalities and atrophy (36%); follow-up showed basal ganglia lesions (50%) and atrophy (55%). CONCLUSION: WD is a diverse chronic disease with generally favourable outcomes for patients who respond to initial therapy, which can be managed predominantly in an ambulatory setting.

AB  - Objectives: To study clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease(WD)and effect of treatment. Methods: This study was carried on 31 patients who were subjected to a detailed clinical history, physical and neurological examination. Slit lamp examination of cornea for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring, biochemical studies (including serum ceruloplasmin, copper and urinary copper) and neuroimaging was done in all patients. Results: The mean age of onset was 12.41 years and the mean delay in diagnosis was 16.96 months. 24 (77.4 %) patients were juveniles (age below 18 years) and 7 (22.6 %) were adults (age more than 18 years). Dystonia was the commonest initial neurologic feature (64.5 %) followed by dysarthria (41.9 %), drooling of saliva (38.7 %) and parkinsonism (38.7 %).Among the main neurologic features, the dystonic group (83.9 %) predominated followed by the parkinsonian group (64.5 %), cerebellar group (22.6 %) and the choreoathetoid group (9.7 %).While parkinsonism predominated in the juvenile group, cerebellar features predominated in the adults. Psychiatric complaints (41.9 %), seizures (19.4 %) and headache (22.5 %) were also observed. Bilateral KF ring was seen in all patients. Non-neuropsychiatric features(bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly and joint pains) were seen predominantly in juveniles. Serum ceruloplasmin was low (<20 mg/dl) in 93.54 % patients, 24 h urinary copper (>100 microgram/ day) was increased in all patients and serum copper was low (<75 microgram/dl) in 64.5 % patients. MRI brain was done in 27 patients with basal ganglia signal changes being the commonest finding (85.2 %). 4 patients had CT scan brain done with basal ganglia hypodensity being the commonest finding (75 %).All patients were treated with zinc and penicillamine. 23 (74.2 %) patients took regular treatment with neurological worsening occurring in 16 (51.6 %) patients. 13 (41.9 %) patients improved completely; 12 (38.7 %) patients showed incomplete improvement with sequelae; 4 (12.9 %) patients remained status quo and were lost in follow up and 2(6.45 %) patients deteriorated and died. Conclusions: This series of WD from Eastern India highlights that the disease is not that rare in India and has varied clinical presentations. Dystonia and parkinsonian features predominated in juvenile patients, while cerebellar features predominated in the adult group. Screening of all asymptomatic siblings for WD must be carried out. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can prevent devastating consequences.

AB  - Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, with an average worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people. Data regarding WD from Pakistan is not available hence we aim to determine the pattern of WD in Pakistan population and wanted to compare with international literature. Methods: Cross sectional study from 1985-2010, conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi. Results: 47 patients were seen, 32 (68.1%) were male with mean age (SD) was 26.6 (9.97) years. Most common mode of presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%) then neurological; 17 (36.2%) and rest were presented with psychiatric symptoms 8 (17%). Patients with psychiatric symptoms had earlier onset of WD at the mean age of 18.8 +/- 3.3 years. Mean ceruloplasmin levels were 0.17 (0.13) and was reduced (<0.25 g/dl) in 39 (86.6%). Serum (Cu) was reduced in 32 (68.1%). 24 hr urinary Cu was raised in only 22 (47.6%). Slit Lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings was done on 15 (31.9%) patients and only 9 (60%) patients were found to have KF rings. Out of these 9 patients with KF ring positive, 8 (88.8%) had neurologic disease. Mean (AST)/(ALT) ratio was 1.92 and median ALP/T. Bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05; 166.50). Thirty one (65.4%) patients were given combination of D-Penicillamine and Zinc (Zn), 11 (23.1%) patients were given only D-Penicillamine and only 5 (11.5%) were on Zn alone. Only one patient who presented with decompensated liver disease underwent liver transplant. Conclusion: Patients with WD present slightly later in adulthood in our population and hepatic presentation is the most common. The disease presentation and biochemical parameters in Pakistan are not different from the rest of the world. WD should be suspected in patients who have unexplained abnormal liver function tests and had family history is positive for liver disease.

AB  - Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder due to impaired hepatic copper excretion resulting in copper accumulation in the liver and many other organs. Limited data are available on the long-term outcome of patients with WD. In Austria 223 patients (2.77/100000 inhabitants) with WD were diagnosed 1961-2011.One patient moved abroad, and could not be reachen Methods: The 165 patients alive or their treating physicians were contacted to obtain information on their current status in 2011. No data were obtained in 56 patients. In these patients information on their survival status was obtained from the Austrian Statistics Office (Statistik Austria, Vienna). The median observation period was period 14.4 years (range: 0.5- 49), total: 3028 patient years. Results: The follow-up study included 222 patients (115 female/107 male; presentation: hepatic: 133; neurologic: 57, asymptomatic 22; age at symptomatic onset 22.3+/-12.3 [range: 2-61] years). 16 patients (7.2%) died during the observation period (in 12 patients death was related to WD - 7 hepatic decompensation, 3 after liver transplantation (LTX), 1 accident to neurologic impairment, 1 suicide). 28 (12.6%) patients required LTX (8 fulminant WD, 19 end stage liver disease, 1 neurologic worsening). LTX was performed within a few months following diagnosis; only 3 patients underwent LTX several years after diagnosis (inspite of good treatment compliance). Overall survival was 92% after 20 years, slightly worse than that of the age adjusted Austrian population (97%). Survival of patients living 10 years after diagnosis was not different form the healthy cohort. 96 vs. 99%). 41 (18.4%) fully recovered, and 38 (17.1 %) patients improved after initiation of therapy (d-pecillamine or trientine). Most of the remaining patients were stable, only 7 deteriorated (3.2%) despite of medical therapy. No clinical follow up was obtained in 45 patients. Conclusion: WD is associated with serious, often fatal liver disease. 12.6% require liver transplantation. If patients survive for 10 years after initiation of treatment (medical or transplantation) their long-term prognosis in terms of survival and of clinical condition is excellent. Thus early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is mandatory to further improve survival and decrease the need for transplantation.

AB  - Background: There are no comprehensive clinical accounts of Wilson's disease [WD, an autosomal recessive disorder (OMIM 277900) of copper transport] in Oman, where there is a high frequency of consanguineous marriages. Objective: To study the neurological, demographic and imaging profiles of WD cases in Oman and to ascertain the time delay in diagnosis. Design and methods: The clinical features and MRI findings of WD cases (who attended the Neurological service of Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman) were retrieved from the electronic patient records. Patients were also contacted by telephone to ascertain the family history and the time-delay in diagnosis. Results: We studied a total of 22 cases (13 males and 9 females) from 4 different Omani families. 9 subjects from these families had neurological manifestations, with the mean age at symptom onset of 18 years (range: 12-24). These subjects demonstrated varying combinations and severity of dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, pyramidal signs and affective disorder. MRI showed basal ganglionic signal changes in those with persisting neurological deficits (n=4). Median time-delay in the diagnosis was 3 months (range: 0-16 months). Maintenance treatment included penicillamine (n= 3), trientine (n= 4) and zinc sulphate (n= 2). A recent genetic study of one of the 4 families revealed a novel homozygous splice site mutation (C.2866-2A>G) upstream of exon 13 in the copper transporter gene ATP 7B. Conclusions: Dystonia is the prominent neurological phenotype of WD in Oman. Clinical awareness and evaluation of close family members facilitated early diagnosis of this rare (but eminently treatable) disease.

AB  - Background: One of the priorities of the French National Reference Center (FNRC) for Wilson Disease (WD), labeled end of 2005, is to improve the epidemiological knowledge of this rare disease. The objective of database for WD is to better define different profiles likely to evoke the diagnosis and to learn more about the disease evolution. Methods: Demographical, clinical, biological, radiological and therapeutic data of the 395 patients (aged from 1 to 77 years old) in the two reference centres (AP-HP and Lyon) and the 6 competence centres (Besanon, Lille, Aix/Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Rennes) of the FNRC for WD have been collected at time of diagnosis and/or during follow up. Results: The diagnosis has been set up most of the time after neurological symptoms (33 %), mean age of 23 years old, or hepatic symptoms (34 %) or with familial screening (20 %). The genetic investigation was not significant for 16 % of the families. D-Penicillamine has been the initial treatment for 85 % of the patients and still prescribed after 15 years of follow up for 44 % of the cases. The mean causes of death are hepatic failure, infections and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion(s): As far as we know, this is the most important cohort of WD patients. However, it covers only about 1/3 of the French patients. In order to improve the registration of the WD patients in the database either at time of diagnosis or during follow up, the coordination of all healthcare professionals with a multidisciplinary approach must be encouraged. The French registry contributes greatly to Eurowilson database due to the number of patients included and followed.

AB  - Background: Wilsons disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, with an average worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people. Data regarding WD from Pakistan is not available hence we aim to determine the pattern of WD in Pakistan population and wanted to compare with international literature. Methods: Cross sectional study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi. Results: Total of 47 patients seen,32 (68.1%) were male. Mean age (SD) was 26.6 (9.97) yrs. Most common presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%), neurological; 17 (36.2%) and rest 8(17%) were presented with psychiatric symptoms. Ceruloplasmin levels was reduced (<0.25 g/dl) in 39 (86.6%), reduced serum Cu in 32 (68.1%). 24 h urinary Cu was raised in only 22(47.6%).Slit Lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings was done on 15 (31.9%) patients and only 9 (60%) had KF rings. Out of these 9 patients with KF ring positive, 8 (88.8%) had neurologic disease. Mean AST)/ALT ratio was 1.92 and median Alkaline Phosphatase/Total Bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05; 166.50). 31 (65.4%) patients were given combination of D-Penicillamine and Zinc (Zn), 11(23.1%) were given only D-Penicillamine and only 5 (11.5%) were on Zn alone. Only one patient with decompensated liver disease underwent liver transplant. Conclusions: Patients with WD present slightly later in adulthood in our population and hepatic presentation is the most common. The disease presentation and biochemical parameters in Pakistan are not different from the rest of the world.

TI  - Epilepsy in Wilson's disease (WD)
AU  - Kumar, N.
AU  - Joshi, D.
T2  - Movement Disorders
AB  - Objective: To evaluate patients of WD with epilepsy. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive treatable disorder of copper accumulation and copper toxicity having protean manifestations involving mainly brain and liver. Neurologically it manifests as a movement disorder, with abnormalities of speech, tremor, incoordination and dystonia being common features. Epilepsy is not a common presentation of WD. Methods: We evaluated 31 patients of WD and found 6 of them having epilepsy. These patients underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) apart from the detailed history, general and neurological examination, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring in cornea, routine biochemical and copper studies (serum ceruloplasmin, 24 hour urinary copper and serum copper), and neuroimaging. Results: Of the 6 (19.4%) patients having epilepsy, 4 (66.7%) were male and rest female. 4 (66.7%) patients were in the juvenile group(<=18 years age)while other 2 (33.3%) were in the adult group (>=18 years age). The 4 juvenile patients presented with predominant dystonic features and the 2 adult patients had both neurological and psychiatric features. 4 (66.7%) patients had complex partial seizures with secondary generalization while 2 (33.3%) had generalized seizures. 1 (16.7%) patient also had occasional myoclonic jerks. EEG was abnormal in all 6 patients with theta background and focal and generalized discharges seen. In 4 (66.7%) patients seizures started before initiating decoppering therapy while in 2 patients it started later. All the patients responded well to antiepileptics. The response of the WD itself to treatment was more variable with 2 (33.3%) patients showing improvement, 3 (50%) patients showing initial deterioration with slight improvement and 1 (16.7%) patient deteriorated and died. Conclusions: The prevalence of epilepsy in our study is 19.4%. It is around 30 times higher than the prevalence of epilepsy in general population and hence it is unlikely to represent a chance relationship. It may result either due to direct toxicity of copper (probably by inhibition of membrane ATPase) or due to pyridoxine deficiency during penicillamine use or due to a metabolic encephalopathy like state. Although prognosis of epilepsy in WD is comparable to that in general population but how much it affects the prognosis of WD needs evaluation of a larger series of such patients.

AB  - Objective: This study has analyzed the Wilson's disease patients' speech behavior. Background: Wilson's disease is described as autosomal recessive and is characterized by deposition of copper mainly in the liver and central nervous system. Among neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease, the problems of speech can occur, but they are little known and described, what makes it difficult the elaboration of efficient intervention procedures. Methods: Thirty patients who are diagnosed and treated in the Neurology Department, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 16 males and 14 females aged between 19 and 58 years old, are all under medical treatment (D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate) in variable doses. They were also submitted to phonoaudiological evaluation that consists on perception auditive qualified analysis of speech behavior. Results: Analysis showed 7 (seven) patients (23,2%) without speech alterations, 9 patients (30%) with anarthria and 14 patients (46,67%) with dysarthria. In this last group, 1 patient (3,33%) in low level, 8 patients (26,66%) in moderate level and 5 patients (16,66%) in accentuated level. Conclusions: These results suggest that there isn't a standard in the disease manifestation as well as clinical speech expression is variable. So, to improve the comprehension of Wilson's disease's several clinical forms, treatment and rehabilitation, systematic studies that correlate clinical signs and symptoms with functional tests and laboratory and image exams are necessary.

T2  - Movement Disorders
AB  - Objective: To characterise the presenting features of Wilson's disease (WD) patients and the response to treatment. Background: WD is an inherited metabolic disorder causing mainly neuro-psychiatric, and hepatic dysfunctions. Untreated, it causes severe morbidity and case fatalities. Long-term clinical follow- up data are limited in literature. Methods: 135 consecutive patients diagnosed as Neuro-WD in the Movement Disorder Clinic of a tertiary care centre of India (Bangur Institute of Neurology) were included. Study period was from June, 1996 to December, 2011. This is both a retrospective (28) and a prospective study (107). The diagnosis of WD was made by Sternlieb's criteria. KF ring was positive in all, Data was compiled in semistructured proforma. Treatment was with D-penicillamine and zinc salts. Additionally, other medications were given as required. The patients were followed up at regular intervals. Results: Mean age of onset was 11.79 years; (males: females 584:51). Mean duration of disease before diagnosis was 15.30 months. Family history of WD was present in 22.96%; consanguineity in 10.37%. History of jaundice was present in 47.41%; hepatic disease in 44.44%. Presenting features were: dysarthria- 90.44%, parkinsonism- 81.62%, dystonia- 90.4%, tremors- 51.11%, choreo-athetosis in 11.85%, ataxia- 11.76%, sialorrhoea- 77.21%, dysphagia- 55.88%, seizure- 17.16%, psychiatric- 62.31%; arthralgia/arthritis- 3.7%, myopathy- 7.5%, amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea - 7.5%, darkening of skin colour- 11.6%, bleeding disorders- 7%. Mean time for improvement was 7.11 months. 14.58% patients initially worsened on D-penicillamine which didi not recur on restarting the drug at lower doses. Dysarthria and residual dystonia were the commonest residual deficits (86% and 90.4% respectively). Behavioral abnormalities often worsened even though the physical symptoms improved. KF ring disappeared in 7.40% and urinary copper levels normalized in 11.11%. 33.33% of patients were drug defaulters, at least once. 7.407% became symptom free;15.55%- had residual symptoms but were meaningfully employed; 25.92%- had symptoms but could do ADL; 24.44%- partially dependent; and 16.30%-severely dependent. Mortality was 10.37%. Conclusions: Dystonia and dysarthria were the commonest features. Early treatment leads to better results. Treatment needs to be individualized. Drug defaulters rapidly worsened.

AB  - Background and aim: Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism. In the pediatric age most cases have a hepatic presentation. It is widely accepted that penicillamine is the first-choice therapy for children with liver disease while zinc is indicated in presymptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of exclusive zinc monotherapy in WD children with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Material and methods: All WD patients referred to our Department of Pediatrics for diagnostic investigation of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. The diagnosis of WD was established in presence of at least two of the following features: a low ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL), an increased basal urinary copper level (>100 mcg/24 hours), an increased urinary copper level after the penicillamine challenge test (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), an increased liver copper level (>250 mcg/g of dry weight). Among43 enrolled WD patients,29 were treated with zinc for a median period of12 years (range 3-25). Zinc was the initial therapy of choice in12 cases. Normalization of serum ALT was the main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study. Compliance to therapy was evaluated on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Among17 (58%) children, treated with penicillamine as first choice, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of14 months (range,4 to48), and started maintenance therapy with zinc. The remaining13 (76%) patients with persistent hyper-ALT during penicillamine switched to zinc; nine of these (70%) normalized ALT on zinc within a median period of9.5 months (range, 5 to151). Eleven (92%) of the12 patients, given zinc alone as first-choice, normalized ALT within a median period of14 months (range,2 to46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT on zinc showed a poor compliance to treatment. According to24 hour urinary copper excretion (56+4 versus 37+2 mcg) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy in terms of decopperization was comparable in two groups. Conclusions: Although penicillamine therapy is generally used for the initial treatment of Wilson disease, the present study has showed that zinc monotherapy may be used, as first line therapy, in WD children with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation.

AB  - Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder, leading to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines favour the use of chelating agents (dpenicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic patients. Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events leading to impaired kidney function or bone marrow depression are a concern especially under d-pencillamine therapy. Based on few case reports, a predictive value for anti nuclear antibodies (ANA) in this context has been suggested. Aim: The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of coexisting or therapy related immune mediated disease in WD patients and to evaluate the role of anti nuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring in a retrospective cohort study. Patients and Methods: A total of 222 WD patients in an European tertiary care center were analysed retrospectively. Medical regimens were classified and analysed for adverse events and course of anti nuclear antibodies. Results: Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 153/222 (69.0%) and in 71/222 (32.0%) patients, respectively. Confirmed coexisting immune mediated diseases were evident in 28/222 (12.6%) patients. Data on course of ANA under treatment and conclusive data on adverse events were available for 91 treatments with D-penicillamine, 58 treatments with trientine and 58 treatments with zinc salts. Within these treatments an increase of ANA titres were observed in 16/91 (17.6%) patients in the d-penicillamine group, in 12/58 (20.7%) patients in the trientine group and in 7/58 (12.1%) patients in the zinc group (p=n.s.). Analysis of adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatments showed no correlation to a preceding increase of ANA titres in all groups. Conclusion: In our cohort elevation of ANA was a frequent finding, but not related to disease presentation and independent from the applied medical regimen.We did not observe a correlation between an increase of ANA and the development of related immune mediated adverse events in all treatment groups and especially in the d-penicillamine group. Thus the value of this parameter for monitoring for adverse events seems to be clearly limited.

AB  - Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of the copper metabolism leading to the accumulation of this metal in different organs and tissues. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the main clinical features of the disease. Objective: The aim of study is to analyze the clinical presentation, epidemiological features, the disease course and the response to therapy in a historical cohort of 36 Brazilian WD patients. Patients and Methods: 36 patients with WD, diagnosed from 1971 to 2010, and followed in the south of Brazil were reviewed. Diagnosis of WD was based on clinical presentation, familial history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum cerulosplasmin, increased 24 h urinary copper excretion, liver biopsy, genetic test and/or response to a D-penicillamine provocative test. Results: There were 16 (44.4%) male and 20 female (56.6%) patients, with mean age of 34.6+/-10.8 years, with high predominance of an exclusively European continental origin (74.5%). Mean age at the initial symptom presentation was 23.2+/-9.3 years. The time since the first clinical symptom and the definitive diagnosis was of 27.5+/-41.9 months. At presentation, 9 patients (25%) showed exclusively neuropsychiatric symptoms, 14 (38.9%) exclusively hepatic symptoms, 11 (30.6%) demonstrated both hepatic and neuropsychiatric features (mixed presentation) and 2 (5.5%) were asymptomatic. Treatment used included D-penicillamine (94.2%) and zinc acetate (5.8%). Conclusion: Our cohort of WD patients has the European continental origin as a unique characteristic, which differs from previous series described in Brazil. The follow-up and response to treatment was similiar to previous studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term data on the clinical follow-up and the treatment effectiveness of Wilson's disease are limited because of the low disease frequency. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of Wilson's disease patients from southern Brazil during a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six Wilson's disease patients, diagnosed from 1971 to 2010, were retrospectively evaluated according to their clinical presentation, epidemiological and social features, response to therapy and outcome. RESULTS: Examining the patients' continental origins showed that 74.5% had a European ancestor. The mean age at the initial symptom presentation was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months until definitive diagnosis. At presentation, hepatic symptoms were predominant (38.9%), followed by mixed symptoms (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were identified in 55.6% of patients, with a higher frequency among those patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%). Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was detected in 68% of the patients with hepatic symptoms. 94.2% of all the patients were treated with D-penicillamine for a mean time of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combined therapy and liver transplantation. After initiating therapy, 78.8% of the patients had a stable or improved outcome, and the overall survival rate was 90.1%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a population of Wilson's disease patients of mainly European continental origin who live in southern Brazil. Wilson's disease is treatable if correctly diagnosed, and an adequate quality of life can be achieved, resulting in a long overall survival. Â© 2011 CLINICS.

AB  - Description Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper overlap, dominated by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms. The aim of this study is to review the genetic aspects, diagnosis and treatment of Neuro-Wilson. Methods We report seven cases collected in the department of Neurology and Pediatrics CHU Hassan II of Fez. Results All patients had neurological signs with or without extra-neurological symptoms. They had complete blood count, liver function, renal balance, copper balance, brain imaging, abdominal ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on clinical, biological and radiological results. Three patients were treated with D-penicillamin and the others received the zinc. The family survey in search of similar cases was carried out by clinical examination of siblings of four patients. Conclusion When left untreated, the evolution of Wilson's disease is always fatal. Treatment is based on the chelating copper, zinc salts and liver transplantation [7].The prognosis of Wilson's disease appears even better than the neurological and liver symptoms are not pronounced.

AB  - Background & Aims: Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper storage, leading to liver failure and neurologic deterioration. Patients are treated with copper chelators and zinc salts, but it is not clear what approach is optimal because there have been few studies of large cohorts. We assessed long-term outcomes of different treatments. Methods: Patients in tertiary care centers were retrospectively analyzed (n = 288; median follow-up time, 17.1 years) for adherence to therapy, survival, treatment failure, and adverse events from different treatment regimens (chelators, zinc, or a combination). Hepatic treatment failure was defined as an increase in activity of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase) >2-fold the upper limit of normal or >100% of baseline with an increase in urinary copper excretion. Results: The median age at onset of Wilson disease was 17.5 years. Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred in 196 (68.1%) and 99 (34.4%) patients, respectively. Hepatic treatment failure occurred more often from zinc therapy (14/88 treatments) than from chelator therapy (4/313 treatments; P < .001). Actuarial survival, without transplantation, showed an advantage for chelating agents (P < .001 vs zinc). Changes in treatment resulted mostly from adverse events, but the frequency did not differ between groups. Patients who did not respond to zinc therapy showed hepatic improvement after reintroduction of a chelating agent. Conclusions: Treatments with chelating agents or zinc salt are effective in most patients with Wilson disease; chelating agents are better at preventing hepatic deterioration. It is important to identify patients who do not respond to zinc therapy and have increased activities of liver enzymes, indicating that a chelating agent should be added to the therapeutic regimen.

AB  - Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body due to defective biliary copper excretion by hepatocytes. We report a series of 19 patients with WD. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive case series of patients with WD followed in two hospitals of North East of France. Results: Eight men and 11 women were studied. Median follow-up time was 16 years, median age at diagnosis was 18 years (range: 5-71 years). Median age at first symptom was 16 years. In addition to four cases diagnosed by familial screening, clinical manifestations at diagnosis were fatigue (n= 5), jaundice (n= 5), bleeding (n= 1), abnormal movement disorders (n= 2) and fortuitous (n= 2). Cirrhosis was identified in 14 patients, neurological involvement occurred in seven patients and four patients presented with psychiatric disorders. d-penicillamine was the first treatment in 18 patients, discontinued for severe adverse events in seven patients. Trientine or zinc salts were then prescribed. Medical treatment was successful in 13 patients, but five patients underwent liver transplantation. Haemochromatosis was associated in one case, and one patient developed cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion: WD is severe. Medical treatment allows disease control if it is correctly observed. Conversely, worsening with irreversible damage can occur if the treatment is discontinued. Â© 2010 Societenationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

AB  - Objectives and Study: Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism. In the pediatric age most cases have a hepatic presentation: the percentage of WD children presenting with isolated elevated aminotransferases ranges from 14% to 88%. It is widely accepted that penicillamine is the first-choice therapy for children with liver disease while zinc is indicated in presymptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. The optimal medical therapy in patients presenting with isolated elevated serum aminotransferases remains unestablished. This reflects the absence of an agreement on classification of WD patients with isolated hypertransaminasemia as presymptomatic cases, requiring zinc, or cases with hepatic onset, requiring chelating agents. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of exclusive zinc monotherapy inWDchildren with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Methods: All WD patients referred to our Department of Pediatrics for diagnostic investigation of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. The diagnosis of WD was established in presence of at least 2 of the following features: a low ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL), an increased basal urinary copper level (>100 mcg/24 hours), an increased urinary copper level after the penicillamine challenge test (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), an increased liver copper level (>250mg/g of dry weight). Among 43 enrolled WD patients, 29 were treated with zinc for a median period of 12 years (range 3'25). Zinc was the initial therapy of choice in 12 cases. Normalization of serum ALT was the main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study. Compliance to therapy was evaluated on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Among 17 (58%) children, treated with penicillamine as first choice, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range, 4 to 48), and started maintenance therapy with zinc. The remaining 13 (76%) patients with persistent hyper-ALT during penicillamine switched to zinc; nine of these (70%) normalized ALT on zinc within a median period of 9.5 months (range, 5 to 151). Eleven (92%) of the 12 patients, given zinc alone as first choice, normalized ALT within a median period of 14 months (range, 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT on zinc showed a poor compliance to treatment. According to 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56+/-4 versus 37+/-2mg) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy in terms of decopperization was comparable in 2 groups. Conclusion: Although penicillamine therapy is generally used for the initial treatment of WD, the present study has showed that zinc monotherapy may be used, as first line therapy, in WD children with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation.

AB  - Objective: To review the clinical experience with Wilson's disease followed in a liver (LC) and movement disorders clinic (MDC) at a single centre in Toronto,Canada. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is uncommon in Western countries. Long term follow-up and experience is therefore rare. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosis of WD attending a LC and MDC. Results: Forty eight patients were included based on Leipzig criteria. The follow-up ranged from 0 - 26.8y in the LC and 0 - 19.8y in the MDC. Fourteen patients presented asymptomatically, 13 with hepatic symptoms, 15 with neurological symptoms, and 6 with dual hepatic/neurological symptoms. Median age at presentation was > 40y in 12.5%. Initial ceruloplasmin was low in 94% of cases, while 24h urinary copper was high in 95%. Neurological patients presented with a median of 4 symptoms (tremor, dysarthria and gait abnormalities were the commonest) while three patients developed neurological symptoms after diagnosis. Additional psychiatric symptoms were present in 26%. All neurologically presenting patients had KF rings. When MRI was performed abnormalities were reported in all patients with neurological symptoms but were normal in patients with pure liver symptoms or asymptomatic. Abnormalities included basal ganglia (62%) and brainstem (50%) lesions, atrophy (50%) and white matter changes (51%). D-penicillamine (D-P) was the most common initial therapy (48%) with zinc the most common at the time of review (65%). One patient had a successful liver transplant. Side effects were most prominent with D-P (41%). Neurological deterioration occurred in 11 subjects due to D-P or non-compliance but with 9 showing recovery. With neurological presentation, 14/21 had improved at time of review. Overall one death occurred. Conclusions: WD remains a diverse disease with generally favourable outcomes for those responding to initial therapy. However, evidence of compensated liver injury and structural brain damage are common and emphasize the need for close monitoring and therapy compliance with joint liver and movement disorder clinics.

AB  - Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder, leading to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Lifelong medical treatment is necessary to maintain copper homeostasis. Optimal treatment regimens in pregnant women are under debate in respect to abortion rate, teratogenicity and therapeutic efficacy. Aim: The current study aimed to assess outcomes of pregnancies in a retrospective multicenter cohort study Patients and methods: A total of 207 pregnancies in 100 WD patients in European tertiary care centers were analysed retrospectively. Medical regimens (D-penicillamine, Trientine, zinc salts, or a combination of a chelator and zinc) were classified and files were reviewed for maternal hepatic or neurological deterioration during pregnancy. Outcome of pregnancies and abortion rate were analyzed in respect to the maternal treatment and disease presentation. Results: Worsening of liver function tests was evident in 10 cases and occurred under all treatments to a similar extent. Liver function resolved after delivery in all cases. Neurologic deterioration in pregnancy was rare and was observed only in 2 cases (one under zinc, one under D-penicillamine therapy), but resulted in permanent worsening of the neurologic symptoms. Overall abortion rate was 48/207 (23.2%) in the study group. Of these, 46 abortions were recorded within the first three months; two still births were associated with placental insufficiency. Abortion rate under Trientine treatment (8/20; 40%; p=0.04) was higher than under D-penicillamine (14/96; 14.7%) or zinc (2/19; 10.5%). We observed inborn defects in 2/159 newborn: One child presented with partial oesophageal atresia (under D-penicillamine therapy of the mother), another child was diagnosed with a Glu-6-P-DH deficiency (under zinc therapy). Conclusion: In most cases control of liver function was maintained during pregnancy regardless of the chosen medical regimen. Neurologic deterioration was rare but resulted in severe disability in two cases. Thus, careful monitoring of WD patients during pregnancy is recommended. Contrary to previous reports we observed a higher rate of miscarriages under Trientine treatment. Potential teratogenicity remains a concern especially under D-penicilamine therapy.

AB  - Background: Wilson's disease (WD, MIM #277900) is an autosomal recessive disorder leading to systemic copper accumulation and multiorgan damage. For pediatric patients, hepatic manifestations predominate. Untreated WD causes progressive liver and neurological deterioration. Early treatment is the most effective way of preventing these serious outcome. Objective & Methods: We presented our experience of managing 10 paediatric WD patients. Data on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, ultrasound findings, liver biopsies, genetic studies, treatment and outcome were studied. Results: Our patients were between 2 to 18 years of age at diagnosis. 1 patient presented in liver failure. 7 had abnormal liver functions detected incidentally. 2 were diagnosed through sibling screening. The most consistent abnormal liver function was an elevated alanine transaminase ranging from 60 to 419 IU/l (<58). Ceruloplasmin levels were all <0.1 g/l (0.21-0.59). Mean urinary copper excretion was 4 mumol/day (<1.0). 1 patient was treated initially with penicillamine and another trientine. 7 patients were started on zinc therapy. All remained well on follow up. Conclusion: Our patients represented a group of asymptomatic WD patients diagnosed and treated very early. With good treatment compliance, favourable outcome can be anticipated. One way of diagnosing these presymptomatic patients is through following up abnormal liver functions.

AB  - Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder, leading to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines favour the use of chelating agents (dpenicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic patients but optimal regimens still have to be established. Clinical data on larger cohorts comparing these chelators are limited. Aim: The current study aimed to assess long-term outcomes of d-penicillamine and trientine in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients and Methods: A total of 350 WD patients in European tertiary care centers and patients contributed by the EUROWILSON database research group were analysed retrospectively. Chelator based medical regimens were analysed for efficacy, adverse events and reasons for discontinuation using Kaplan-Meier-estimation. Treatments with duration of less than 6 months were censored. Results: Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 221 (63.1%) and in 119 (34%) patients, respectively. Patients were treated initially with d-penicillamine (n = 309) or trientine (n = 41). Changes of medication were common in both groups, resulting in a total of 514 analysed treatments (d-penicillamine n = 350, trientine n = 164). Actuarial survival free of transplantation (median follow-up: 16.5 years) was similar (death: d-penicillamine n = 7/350, trientine n = 3/164; progression to liver transplantation: d-penicillamine 12/350, trientine 2/164). In the d-penicillamine group, adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were more frequent (p = 0.045) and occurred even after decades of therapy. For the latest available time point of a 48 months follow-up, hepatic deterioration occurred only in 8/514 treatments (d-penicillamine n = 3, trientine n = 5, p = n.s.). However, neurologic deterioration was less frequent in the d-penicillamine group (7/350 treatments) compared to trientine (12/164, p = 0.005) while improvement of symptomatic neurologic patients was recorded to a similar extent (d-penicillamine 84/139; trientine 42/79, p = n.s.). Interestingly, hepatic improvement of symptomatic patients was more often observed for d-penicillamine (211/235) than for trientine (64/86, p < 0.05). Conclusion: In the majority of patients treatment with chelating agents was effective, leading to a comparable and favourable actuarial survival free of transplantation. The main limitation in d-penicillamine treatment was the higher rate of adverse events. Neurological deterioration under chelation therapy was rare and contrary to our expectation more frequent in patients treated with trientine.

T2  - European journal of pediatrics
AB  - Our aim was to review our experience of trientine as chelation therapy in children with Wilson disease (WD) and compare to that reported in the literature. We made a retrospective review of the medical notes of 16 of 96 (17%) children diagnosed with WD between 1981 and 2006. Children were 6.6 to 15 years old. Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parental choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine (one) during the penicillamine challenge], 13 of 16 were converted from penicillamine to trientine because of reactions to penicillamine: haematuria in four, bone marrow suppression in three, neutropenia in three. Trientine was discontinued in three due to allergic rash, low copper excretion and one with compliance problems requiring transplantation. Seventy-five per cent of children presented with chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were noticed in eight of 16, Wilson Ferenci score range was between 4 and 10 (nl < 4). Laboratory indices remained relatively stable. In line with previous reports, trientine was used mainly as secondary treatment when there were severe side effects with penicillamine. Whilst the current evidence is low quality, it appears that trientine is as efficacious as penicillamine and small population studies show a lower side effect profile.

TI  - Wilson France: A national database for Wilson's disease
AU  - Trocello, J. M.
T2  - Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases. Conference: 5th European Conference on Rare Diseases, ECRD
AB  - Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disease with an efficient treatment if initiated early. Improving the knowledge of this disease is a priority of the French national Centre of Expertise for a better access to diagnosis and treatment. This national organisation created a database. Objective: Improve the knowledge of WD by an epidemiological study on the French cohort. Methods: We registered all patients followed by all the French centres working with the national Centre of Expertise. Results: Since 2006, 281 patients (1-73 year old) were included in the Wilson France database (sex ratio: 1). Mean age at diagnosis was 19 years. First symptoms were neurological for 36% of the patients, hepatic for 38%, renal, psychiatric or hematologic for 11%. Fifteen percent were diagnosed after familial screening. At time of diagnosis, Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms, in 55% of hepatic presentations and in 26% of the presymptomatic forms. Mean coeruloplasminemia was low (0.08 g/L) but 5% of patients had normal values (>0.2 g/L). Mean urinary copper was increased in 96% of the patients. Genetic investigation was not conclusive in 15.9 % of the families (only one or no mutation found). First treatment was D-Penicillamine in 85% of the cases and after a mean follow up of 15 years, the treatment was D-Penicillamine for 44.4% of the patients, Trientine for 14.4%, Zinc for 26.7%, association of chelator and zinc for 5.6 %; 5.6 % of the patients had liver transplantation. Discussion: The database included approximately 1/3 of the Wilson disease patients in France. In order to improve the recruitment of Wilson's disease patients, coordination of all health professionals with a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. This work is realised in collaboration with Eurowilson database.

AB  - Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion into bile, leading to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, haemolytic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases. WD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Affected children may be entirely asymptomatic and the diagnosis problematic. The objective of this study is to present our single center experience over one year with WD, underlying his different presentations. Patients and methods: In the last 12 months (from april 2009 to april 2010) 5 patients (3 males) fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of WD. Evaluation included detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory testing (urinary copper excretion, levels of serum ceruloplasmin), genetic analysis, and liver biopsy. 3 patients presented isolated liver disease, 1 had mixed neurological and hepatic involvement and 1 presented with acute liver failure. All 3 patients with cirrothic liver underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Results: The median age at diagnosis of WD was 10.8 (range, 7-16). All patients had hepatic manifestations of the disease when diagnosed: cirrhosis (2), chronic hepatitis (2) and fulminant hepatic failure (1). Two patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 1 of the symptomatic patients presented the typical neurological symptoms, first with changes in behaviour and deterioration in schoolwork evolving to lack of motor coordination, drooling, dysarthria, dystonia, and spasticity with the deeping of the disease. At diagnosis, just the patient with neurological manifestation had positive Kayser Fleischer ring. Serum ceruloplasmine levels were decreased in all patients, median value 9.2 mg/dl (range 2-16), with lower levels in cirrhotic patients. The 24-h excretion of copper in urine was raised in all patients, >75 mug/24 hours before (median value 360 mug/24) or >1400 mug/24 hours after penicillamine challenge. Genetic analysis showed double eterozighosis in 3/5, the other 2 patients had just 1 recognized mutation. As diagnostic important proved all patients had the copper content of more than 250 mug/g hepatic dry weight. We started zinc therapy (zinc acetate) in all the patients at the time of diagnosis, just in the one with neurological symptoms with added a copper chelator drug as Trientine. None of 3 cirrhotic patients recovered with therapy and avoided liver transplantation. In the 2 asymptomatic patients zinc acetate therapy was started and well tolerated. In those 2 patients liver function tests showed improvement after 3 weeks of therapy reaching normal values in 2 months for both. The indication for liver transplantation was acute on chronic (2/3) or fulminant, liver failure (1/3). The median follow-up after liver transplantation was 1 year, 1 patient died for perioperative complications (66% patient survival). Copper metabolism returned to normal in all patients. None of the transplanted patients with exclusive liver disease required chelation treatment after liver transplantation and none developed neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease. Conclusion: Detection of WD in children remains very difficult also due low frequency of cases, however our 1 year experience show higher frequency than reported in the literature. The most important investigation is liver biopsy with the assessment of liver copper. Genetic analysis may help in doubtful cases. Ceruloplasmine, haemoglobin, ALT, ALP and plasma albumin were significantly different between fulminant and non-fulminant WD and could be used as indirect markers in evaluation of urgent OLT. It is important to be aware of the different manifestations of Wilson's disease in the pediatric population, in order to make appropriate evaluations in a timely manner to facilitate early diagnosis, to ensure appropriate treatment and to avoid the ri k of underestimate it.

T2  - Hepatology
AB  - Aim: To review the clinical experience for adult patients with Wilson's disease (WD) followed in an urban ambulatory setting. Methods: A retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of WD was performed. Results: 59 charts were identified; based on Leipzig scores, 44 met criteria for likely (score >= 4) and 10 for probable WD (score 2-3). On review, 6 cases were excluded (1 likely, 5 probable). Presentation characteristics of the 48 patients included are shown in Table 1. At review, median time on treatment was 11.5 years (range 0.1-42 years). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial therapy (48%), followed by zinc (23%), trientine (15%), DP and zinc (6%), and 8% unknown (initiated on treatment as part of a double blinded study). At review, zinc was the most common regimen (65%), followed by DP (17%), trientine (12%), and dual-therapy (6%). Side effects were most notable for DP (41%) compared to zinc (19%) or trientine (10%). Overall, liver biopsy and/or imaging demonstrated presence of portal hypertension in 63% and cirrhosis in 53% of patients. Liver biopsy (n=31) also identified fibrosis in 94% of patients, inflammatory activity in 68% and steatosis in 65%. Where evaluated, 10 patients had EM mitochondrial changes, and 13 glycogenated nuclei. Median liver copper concentration was 4.11muM/g (range 0.22-20.43). During follow up, 3 patients developed hepatic encephalopathy and 2 became jaundiced. 2 patients developed ascites (one of whom was initially asymptomatic) and 1 variceal bleed was documented. At time of review, there was one death and one transplant. Neurological WD patients (n=21) presented with a median of 4 neurological signs consistent with WD. At review, 14 patients had fewer neurological signs, 2 the same number, 4 more signs (1 patient lost to followup). Three patients with non-neurological presentation developed neurological signs, of which 1 recovered to baseline. Eleven patients had at least one episode of documented neurological decline while on treatment. Of patients who underwent an MRI (n=26), signal abnormalities were seen in the basal ganglia (62%), brainstem (50%), white matter tracts (38%), and thalamus (28%). Eight patients (31%) had normal brain MRI's. Of patients with a second MRI (n=11), 36% saw almost complete improvement. Conclusion: Wilson's disease is a diverse illness but outcomes are generally good over the long term for patients responding to initial therapy. (Table presented).

AB  - Outcome of exclusive zinc monotherapy for symptomatic Wilson disease may be unfavourable, particularly in case of advanced hepatic disease (Hepatol 2009;50:1442-52). Initial decoppering with penicillamine might improve outcome, but available data are scarce and long-term follow up is not available. We here report our experience with such approach in 30 symptomatic pts during (median) 29 (range 0.5-48) yrs follow up (FU). Presentation was exclusive hepatic, exclusive neurologic or combined in 14, 3 and 13 cases resp. Mean age at diagnosis was 14 (range 7-37) yrs. Duration and dose of initial penicillamine were 2 (0.5-21) yrs and 873 (162-2000) mg resp. and of subsequent zinc 23 (0.5-42) yrs and 175 (68-279) mg resp. Of the 27 pts with hepatic or combined presentation, 3 exhibited initial decompensated cirrhosis, 11 compensated cirrhosis and 13 less severe disease. Of the 3 pts with initial decompensated cirrhosis, one improved to compensated cirrhosis and remains so during 23 yrs FU, 1 was transplanted after after 0.5 yr, and one initially improved but died 12 yrs later from complications of cirrhosis. Of the 11 pts with initial compensated cirrhosis (median FU 31 yrs), 1died after 2 yrs from penicillamine-induced myelinolysis, 3 died from complications of liver disease after 17, 20 and 30 yrs therapy and 7 remain stable after median 29 yrs FU. Of 13 pts with less severe hepatic disease, 9 deteriorated, including 5 to compensated and 1 to decompensated cirrhosis (the latter recompensating after trientine addition). Progressive hepatic disease was associated with longer follow up (median 31 vs 26 yrs, P=0.03) but could not be clearly explained by dose or duration of therapy or efficiency of decoppering (based on 24-hr urine copper excretion and serum non-ceruloplasmin bound copper conc. at end of FU). Of the 16 pts with initial neurologic or combined presentation, neurologic symptoms improved in 7, remain stable in 4, and deteriorated in 5 (including 1 with subsequent death from pneumonia). 3 pts with exclusive hepatic presentation developed neurologic symptoms and one pt with exclusive neurologic presentation developed hepatic disease during follow up. Major side effects occurred exclusively during penicillamine: glomerulonefritis (n=2) and death from myelinolysis (n=1). In conclusion, although short term clinical outcome is often satisfactory, hepatic Wilson disease tends to progress during long term zinc monotherapy, even after initial penicillamine decoppering.

AB  - Objectives and Study: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of zinc acetate in the treatment of Wilson's Disease (WD) in children. Methods: Twenty six WD patients treated with zinc acetate were included in this multicenter study. Clinical and biological data were collected via a questionnaire: age and symptoms at diagnosis of WD, age at beginning of zinc therapy, efficacy on biological parameters, side effects. Results: At presentation, 23 patients (88%) were asymptomatic, mostly diagnosed during a familial work-up; 23 patients (88%) had liver disease, and one (4%) had neurological symptoms. A Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 15% of cases. Diagnosis of WD was made at a median age of 8 years (0.8 - 16.1). According to the centre, the percentage of WD patients treated with zinc varied from 8.5 to 61.5%. D-penicillamin was associated in 18 patients (69%), trientine in 4 (15%), and 3 patients (11%) received the 3 drugs. Zinc therapy was initiated at the time of diagnosis in 12 patients (46%), as the only drug in 8 cases. Median age at the beginning of zinc therapy was 10.8 years (2.3-12.3) and 2.6 years after the diagnosis of WD. In children who received only zinc, it was started at the age of 7 years (2.3 - 11.1), 5 months after the diagnosis of WD. Zinc was started at the recommended dosage in 11 children and progressively increased in 15 patients. A dosage above the recommended doses was used in 5/6 patients under 5 years of age, 10/19 in patients between 6 and 15 years, and 1/1 patient above 16 years. After the beginning of the treatment, the median ALT and urine copper values normalized in 5 months. Thereafter, urine copper values remained under 50mg/24 h in all patients but one patient with a poor compliance. Epigastralgia (n = 4), vomiting and diarrhea (n = 1), leucopenia (n = 1) and transient increase of serum lipase (n = 1) were observed. Conclusion: Although rarely used in the treatment of WD, zinc acetate effective and well tolerated. The guidelines regarding the dosage and the monitoring should be more closely followed.

AB  - Objectives and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with a highly variable spectrum of clinical manifestations in childhood. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 114 children with WD to determine clinical presentation, diagnostic course and outcome. Methods: The medical reports of 114 children (63 boys) whom were diagnosed as WD between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Physical examination, laboratory tests and liver biopsies of patients were evaluated. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.5+/- 3.2 years (1.5-16 years. There was consanguity in majority of the parents (81, 71.1%. Eighty seven (76.3%) patients were diagnosed as symptomatic cases including 12 patients whom presented with acute liver failure. Twenty seven patients were diagnosed by family screening. Overall 80 patients presented with hepatic, 5 with neurologic, and 17 both hepatic and neurologic features. Hepatomegaly was the most common clinical finding, in 41 patients, while splenomegaly, icterus and ascites were found in 26, 25 and 24 patients respectively. Kayser-Fleischer rings were present in 63 of 109 patients (57.8%) while serum ceruloplasmin level was below 20 mg/dl in 97 of evaluated 114 patients (85.1%). Urinary copper excretion was above 80mg/24 hours in 85 of 102 patients (83.3%). Liver copper above (250mg/g dry weight) was found in 53 (67.0%) of 79 patients. Cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis were the most common findings of liver biopsy (23/79, 29.1% for each). All the patients with acute liver failure died except one who had liver transplantation. Ninety seven non-fulminant WD patients were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulphate, 5 with trientine and zinc sulphate at diagnosis. A total of 6 children were converted to trientine due to adverse reactions of penicillamine (nephrotic syndrome in 2, detoriation of liver functions in 2, Stevens-Johnson reaction in 1, allergic rash in 1 patient). Five patients had liver transplantation during follow-up. Seventy six non-fulminant WD patients had been followed up for 5.0+/- 3.7 years (3 months-14 years). Five patients died during the follow-up because of end stage liver disease. Eighteen patients who were nonadherent to chelation therapy had poor outcome. Conclusion: Wilson's disease in children may present in different forms and needs extensive investigation for diagnosis. Drug treatment is helpful for a stable or improved course of non-fulminant disease. Fulminant WD is almost mortal without liver transplantation.

AB  - Objective: Wilson disease is genetically determined failure of copper metabolism. If untreated, it usually leads to death within several years from the development of clinical symptoms. Drugs which deplete copper should be continued over the whole span of patient's life after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson disease frequently stop the treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate drug compliance (defined by us as persistence with treatment) among Wilson disease patients prescribed different anti-copper drugs, and to assess how it translates into clinical improvement and the total well-being. Methods: Our study was based on a retrospective analysis of information received from self-completion questionnaires given to patients attending Wilson disease clinic. The following data were obtained from each patient: prescribed medication, duration of treatment, persistence with treatment, subjective assessment of health status. EQ-5D questionnaire with visual analogue scale (VAS) of well-being was also used. Results: Response was obtained from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires could be used for further processing. Fifty fife percent of patients were treated with d-penicillamine, and the rest were treated with zinc sulphate. The mean duration of treatment was 10.3 (SD +/- 4.4) years. Our analysis did not reveal differences in persistence with d-penicillamine or zinc sulphate treatment (75.0% vs. 73.0% respectively), nor in efficacy of above medications. We have discovered, however, that regardless of used medication, persistence with drug therapy resulted in significantly better results of selfassessment: "total improvement": 39.7% of vs. 7.7% in persistent vs. non-persistent group, respectively, p=0.003; "partial improvement": 53.8% vs. 30.8%, respectively, p=0.045; "deterioration": 0.0% vs. 42.3%, respectively, p<0.0001. Patients persistent with treatment obtained higher scores in VAS than non persistent (76 vs.67, p=0.05). Conclusion: Persistence with anti-copper treatment is a major factor influencing the long-term clinical outcome in Wilson disease.

AB  - Objective: To study the clinical profiles, laboratory findings, brain imaging of Wilson's disease and response to treatments. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive systemic disorder of copper metabolism due to a defect of copper transport by hepatic lysosomes with secondary pathology resulting from copper overload in liver, brain, kidney and skeletal system. Methods: Cases of Wilson's disease were taken from hospital records from 2004 December to 2009 December. Total 32 cases were diagnosed. Study was carried out to see clinical characteristics, presence of K-F ring, laboratory parameters, biochemical levels and brain imaging. Results: Total 32 cases were diagnosed of Wilson's disease. 22 were male and 10 were female. 28 cases were of less than 15 years of age and 4 were adults. Youngest patient was of 6.5 years of age and oldest patient was of 32 years of age at diagnosis. The mean duration of disease before diagnosis was 6 months in children (<15 yrs) and 2 years in adult (>15 years). In children dystonia was most commonest presentation (90%), parkinsonism (82.5%), both were in 73.4% and tremor in 60% and in adults parkinsonism was commonest presentation (75%), dystonia (50%) and tremor were present in 50% of adult patient. Sialorrhoea was present in 60% of children and 25% of adult patients. Unclear voice were present in 80% of cases. Dysphagia was present in 44% of children and 25% of adult patients. KF ring was absent in 3 children. CT brain was performed in all the cases, most common abnormality observed is bilateral symmetrical hyperlucency of basal ganglia in 13 (40.6%). MRI brain performed in 24 cases. 4 had normal MRI brain. Abnormality were observed in 20 cases, most common was hyperintensities of basal ganglia (62.5%), thalamus in 45% and brainstem in 31.5%. 4 patients were only on zinc and 28 were on both zinc and D-penicillamine. Out of 28 cases 10 has left D-penicillamine (2 due to adverse effects and 8 due to unaffordability). All has excellent response to treatment except one child. Conclusions: Wilson's disease was more common in children. Dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor, sialorrhoea and unclear voice were commonest features. KF ring were present in 91% of cases. Bilateral symmetrical hyperintensities of basal ganglia was commonest MRI abnormality. Zinc is safest to start. Wilson's disease has excellent response to D-penicillamine.

AB  - Introduction: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on Wilson's disease (WD) show lack of correlations between neurological and neuroimaging features. Long-term follow-up reports with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different modalities of treatment are scarce. Methods: Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent pretreatment and posttreatment brain MRI scans to evaluate the range of abnormalities and the evolution along these different periods. All patients underwent at least two MRI scans at different intervals, up to 11 years after the beginning of treatment. MRI findings were correlated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and treatment with two different drugs. Patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: d-penicillamine (D-P), zinc (Zn), and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to D-P. Results: MRI scans before treatment showed, in all patients, hypersignal intensity lesions on T2- and proton-density-weighted images bilaterally and symmetrically at basal nuclei, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum, brain cortex, and brain white matter. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disturbances, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea, and athetosis. Conclusions: From the neurological point of view, there was no difference on the evolution between the group treated exclusively with D-P and the one treated with Zn. Analysis of MRI scans with longer intervals after the beginning of treatment depicted a trend for neuroimaging worsening, without neurological correspondence, among patients treated with Zn. Neuroimaging pattern of evolution was more favorable for the group that received exclusively D-P. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare, but treatable condition that often presents diagnostic dilemmas. Aims: This study presents King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (a tertiary care centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) experience over two decades with patients with WD in order to illustrate the diverse patterns, therepies, and outcomes. Patients & Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD; Mean+/-SD age at presentation was 16.8+/-10.7 (Range: 2-49) years; 40(56.3%) were males; referred to our centre were reviewed and analyzed. Results: The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological, and mixed in 39(54.9%), 14(19.7%), and 18(25.4%) patients respectively, and 11(15.5%) of them were asymptomatic cases detected by family screening. Family history of WD was positive in 41(57.7%) patients, and consanguinity of parents was in 26(36.6%) patients. Kayser Fleiser Ring (KFR) was absent, questionable, and present in 32(45.1%), 3(4.2%), and 36(50.7%) respectively. KFR was positive in 10(71.4%), 11(28.2%), and 15(83.3%) of the patients who had neuological, hepatic, and mixed pictures respectively. The mean follow up period of 92.2+/-72.9 (range: 1-320) month. The mean age at the end of follow up was 25.3+/-12 (Range: 4-62) years. Hepatoma was discovered in 5(7%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58(81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientin were given to 32(45.1) and 11(15.5%) patients respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation. and one died (1.4%) on the waiting list. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow up, while 45(63.4) and 16(22.5%) are still on- or lost from-follow up respectively. The liver condition remained stable or improved in 35(49.3%), and the neurological status showed improvement in 11(34.4%) out of the 32 patients who had neurological involvement. Conclusions: This is the biggest cohort to be reported from the Middle East. WD presentation and outcome of WD are very diverse. Diagnosis of WD still depends mainly on clinical, radiological, and laboratory evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. WD should be considered in patients of any age with obscure hepatic and/or neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Background: Zinc-based drugs seem to be as effective as d-penicillamine in the neurological presentation of Wilson disease but there are very limited data on its efficacy in patients with hepatic symptoms. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of treatment with zinc vs. d-penicillamine in a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with Wilson disease and liver presentation. Material and Methods: We analyzed 27 children with Wilson disease before and after one year of treatment (14 pts. aged 11.7+/-3.3 y receiving zinc and 13 pts. aged 13.4+/-3.2y on d-penicillamine) in whom the therapy was not changed during the observation period. Wilson disease was diagnosed according to the Ferenci et al. scoring system and mutation analysis examination. Patients with acute and fulminant liver failure were excluded from this study. Results: Before the treatment ALT levels were slightly lower in zinc patients than in penicillamine patients (114+/-105 IU/L vs. 197+/-120 IU/L, mean +/-SD). We did not find any difference at baseline in AST, INR and GGTP between the groups. After one year of treatment there was no difference in ALT levels between the zinc and penicillamine group (respectively 56+/-22 IU/L and 50+/-18 IU/L) however the fall in ALT level was significant (p<0.05) in the penicillamine patients but not in the zinc patients. AST activity decreased significantly in both groups. Conclusions: Penicillamine induces a larger fall in ALT level than zinc therapy and might therefore be more effective in children with Wilson disease and liver presentation.

AB  - Aims: To describe the clinical and laboratory features of children with Wilson Disease presenting to the Hospital for Sick Children, a large tertiary care pediatric centre. Methods: Patients diagnosed with Wilson Disease between 2001 and 2008 were identified from clinical databases and a retrospective chart review was performed. Results: Eleven patients were identified, with an average age at presentation of 12 years (range 7-17 years). Nine of 11 patients had a hepatic presentation including jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, pale stools, or hematemesis. Of these patients, three had overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from encephalopathy to paresthesias. Five of the nine patients who presented with liver decompensation also exhibited Coomb's negative haemolytic anemia. Eighteen percent (2/11) presented with isolated neurological complaints (developmental delay and ataxia in one, parasthesiae in the other). These children presented at a younger age (average 7 y) in comparison to the group mean of 12 y. Five of 11 children (45%) presented with Kaiser Fleischer rings. Only one case had a positive family history of Wilson Disease; this family had a history of consanguinity. Through family screening, two separate children were identified to be asymptomatic carriers. At presentation, the average (range) laboratory values were as follows: ceruloplasmin 115 mg/L (27 - 253 mg/l), 24 hour urinary copper excretion 13.7 umol (0.290-60.5), INR 1.9 (0.9-4.3), total bilirubin 85 (4-361), albumin 29 (23-48), AST 238 (44-1083), alkaline phosphatase 251 (20-824), WBC 10.7 (3.7-25.2), haemoglobin 101 g/l (54-134) and platelets 205 (88-460). The new Wilson Disease severity index was calculated for each patient, and ranged from 3 to 16 (on a possible scale of 0 to 20). Among the three patients who scored 11 or above and were therefore predicted to require liver transplantation, one recovered with medical therapy. Children were treated with a combination of chelation agents including penicillamine, trientine and/or zinc. Clinical outcomes were assessed at a mean of 2.5 years (range 0.14-5.8) following diagnosis. None of the children died. Three patients underwent liver transplantation (two soon after diagnosis and one patient five years thereafter). One recently diagnosed patient is currently awaiting transplant. Two patients developed neuropsychiatric symptoms despite chelation treatment. Conclusions: Children with Wilson Disease demonstrate a variety of clinical presentations, have a high likelihood of response to chelation therapy, and occasionally require liver transplantation. The new Wilson Disease index should be used with caution because it does not reliably indicate the need for transplantation.

AB  - We report the progress of 5 patients diagnosed with Wilson' Disease with age range between 13 and 30 years, 3 females and 2 males who developed multiple side effects with initiation of penicillamine therapy including thrombocytopenia (3 patients), allergic skin reactions (3 patients), worsening of neuropsychiatric features (1 patient) and status dystonicus (1 patient). These side effects developed within a month to 6 months after initiation of penicillamine. The stopping of penicillamine therapy and initiation of therapy with Trientene brought about improvement of neuropsychiatric features and amelioration of features of status dystonicus as well as resolution of thrombocytopenia. We would like to propose that patients with Wilsons disease once initiated with penicillamine therapy be followed up closely to look for these side effects and suggest that possibly trientene would be a safer alternative to penicillamine therapy in a subgroup of Wilson's disease patients and possibly better served even as initial therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of ATP7B protein and a reduction in copper excretion into the bile in hepatocytes. Excess copper accumulation leads to liver injury. D-penicillamine primarily can inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the appearance of scar lesions in the liver. We studied this phenomenon in our patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathology slides from the explanted livers of 26 patients diagnosed as having Wilson disease with hepatoneurologic manifestations between 2000 and 2008 who had undergone a liver transplant were investigated retrospectively. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their history of D-penicillamine use before transplant. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation were classified as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3), and were reviewed by an impartial hepatopathologist. RESULTS: Of 26 patients (20 male, 6 female) who had Wilson disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years, 69% (18/26) had a history of D-penicillamine use before liver transplant from 6 months to 9 years (mean, 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis was seen in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18), grade 2 in 44% (8/18), and grade 1 in 11% of the patients (2/18). In the non- D-penicillamine group (8 patients), grades of fibrosis were grade 3 (62%), grade 2 (25%), and grade 1 (12%); 87% of the patients had grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The degree of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than it was in the non-D-penicillamine group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine may reduce the rate of liver fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson disease.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment, and follow-up of a cohort of 29 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) within the region of Murcia. Patients and method: we reviewed the medical records of 29 cases of WD (mean age, 20.3 +/- 13.4 years) diagnosed during the last 16 years. Results: the most frequent reason for consultation was upon discovering a high transaminase level in almost half the patients, followed by tremors or dystonia in 17% of patients, respectively. A Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 17/29 (58.6%) of patients (100% of patients with pure neurological involvement and 35% of patients with pure clinical hepatic disease; p < 0.001). Blood copper levels not associated with ceruloplasmin as well as cupruria were notably superior in patients with neurological symptoms and in those with liver cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. Patient clinical symptoms remained stable with D-penicillamine or trientine, or improved during the observation period, for 18 out of 29 patients (62%), while 11 out of 29 patients (38%) got worse. Conclusions: in our region patients with WD are diagnosed at a younger age, and in most cases for hepatic disease. Patients with neurological disease o liver cirrhosis had a high level of free copper not associated to ceruloplasmin and cupruria. The disease had a favorable evolution in all patients but those diagnosed with hepatic disease or advanced neurological disease. Copyright Â© 2008 Aran Ediciones, S. L.

AB  - Background: The initial treatment of the neurologic presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, used for years on most patients, causes neurologic worsening in up to half of such patients, and half of those who worsen never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We have developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for this type of patient, and it has worked well in open label studies. Trientine, another anticopper drug on the market approved for penicillamine intolerant patients, had not been tried in this type of patient. Here, we report on a double blind trial of TM versus trientine in the neurologically presenting Wilson's disease patient. Design and Methods: The study was a double blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc, or trientine plus zinc, for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they presented with neurologic symptoms from Wilson's disease, if they had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed in the hospital for the 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations, to evaluate possible neurologic worsening. They also had blood and urine studies done weekly. At discharge from hospital they were continued on zinc maintenance therapy, and returned at yearly intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients were entered into the trientine arm and 6 reached criteria for neurologic deterioration, while 25 patients were entered into the TM arm and only 1 deteriorated (p < 0.05). One patient on trientine had an adverse event while 7 on TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurologic and speech recovery over 3 years was good. Interpretation: TM is a superior choice to trientine for the initial therapy of neurologic Wilson's disease. Â© 2008 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Objective: To compare tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in treating patients with the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease for the frequency of neurologic worsening, adverse effects, and degree of neurologic recovery. Design: A randomized, double-blind, controlled, 2-arm study of 48 patients with the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease. Patients either received 500 mg of trientine hydrochloride 2 times per day or 20 mg of tetrathiomolybdate 3 times per day with meals and 20 mg 3 times per day between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received 50 mg of zinc 2 times per day. Patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with neurologic and speech function assessed weekly; discharged taking 50 mg of zinc 3 times per day, and returned annually for follow-up. Setting: A university hospital referral setting. Patients: Primarily newly diagnosed patients with Wilson disease presenting with neurologic symptoms who had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with an anticopper drug. Intervention: Treatment with either trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. Main Outcome Measures: Neurologic function was assessed by semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations. Drug adverse events were evaluated by blood cell counts and biochemical measures. Results: Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm underwent neurologic deterioration (P<.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had adverse effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had further transaminase elevations. One patient receiving trientine had an adverse effect of anemia. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration. Neurologic and speech recovery during a 3-year follow-up period were quite good. Conclusion: Tetrathiomolybdate is a better choice than trientine for preserving neurologic function in patients who present with neurologic disease. Â©2006 American Medical Association.

AB  - Introduction: Study of MRI changes may be useful in diagnosis, prognosis and better understanding of the pathophysiology of Wilson's disease (WD). We aimed to describe and correlate the MRI abnormalities of the brain with clinical features in WD. Methods: MRI evaluation was carried out in 100 patients (57 males, 43 females; mean age 19.3+/-8.9 years) using standard protocols. All but 18 patients were on de-coppering agents. Their history, clinical manifestations and scores for severity of disease were noted. Results: The mean duration of illness and treatment were 8.3+/-10.8 years and 7.5+/-7.1 years respectively. MRI of the brain was abnormal in all the 93 symptomatic patients. The most conspicuous observations were atrophy of the cerebrum (70%), brainstem (66%) and cerebellum (52%). Signal abnormalities were also noted: putamen (72%), caudate (61%), thalami (58%), midbrain (49%), pons (20%), cerebral white matter (25%), cortex (9%), medulla (12%) and cerebellum (10%). The characteristic T2-W globus pallidal hypointensity (34%), "Face of giant panda" sign (12%), T1-W striatal hyperintensity (6%), central pontine myelinosis (7%), and bright claustral sign (4%) were also detected. MRI changes correlated with disease severity scores (P<0.001) but did not correlate with the duration of illness. Conclusion: MRI changes were universal but diverse and involved almost all the structures of the brain in symptomatic patients. A fair correlation between MRI observations and various clinical features provides an explanation for the protean manifestations of the disease. Â© Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The response of serum transaminase levels to penicillamine and zinc treatment in Wilson's disease is poorly understood. The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate transaminase levels after penicillamine and zinc treatment in children with Wilson's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and nine patients with Wilson's disease (median age at diagnosis, 7.2 years; range, 1 to 18 years), treated for at least 12 months and observed in the last 20 years at 11 Paediatric Departments were studied. Clinical, laboratory and histologic features at diagnosis and initial treatment were recorded. Efficacy parameters were normalization of serum transaminase level and improved clinical and/or laboratory signs. One hundred and two patients had clinical or laboratory signs of liver disease. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 87 patients (64%) given penicillamine normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels within a median of 17 months (range, 2 to 96 months). Of the 29 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, 17 (59%) switched to zinc; only four of these normalized ALT on zinc within a median period of 38 months (range, 7 to 48 months). Eleven (50%) of the 22 patients given zinc alone normalized ALT within a median period of 6 months (range, 1 to 36 months). Of the 11 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, five switched to penicillamine. Three of the five normalized ALT within a median period of 6 months (range, 6 to 9 months). Overall, in penicillamine-treated and zinc-treated patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia, ALT decreased from a basal median of 236 IU/L (range, 54 to 640 IU/L) to a median of 78 (range, 46 to 960 IU/L) at the end of follow-up (P = 0.0245). Poor compliance was suspected in only 10% of cases. No predictive factor of persistent hypertransaminasemia was identified. Liver disease did not worsen in any patient during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Although the efficacy of penicillamine and zinc is well documented, it is notable that a subset of children with Wilson's disease-related liver disease (36%) had hypertransaminasemia despite appropriate treatment with penicillamine or zinc.

T2  - Aktuelle Neurologie
AB  - Wilson's disease, an hereditary autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by more than 200 different mutations in the gene (locus 13q14.3), encodes a copper-transporting ATPase 7B. Hepatic manifestations became apparent mainly during the first, neurological and psychiatric during the second or third decade of life, seldom later. Genotype-phaenotype correlations are probably. The diagnosis involves laboratory tests (Cu-metabolism), molecular genetics and, if necessary, liver biopsy. Treatment must be continued lifelong, without disruption, also in the pregnancy. Besides D-Penicillamin, which has been the drug of choice for many years, Trientine, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate are used with good success. Monitoring (copper balance, side effects) - at least once or twice yearly - is necessary. Cerebral MRI and FDG-PET seems to be a useful tool in practise for long-term therapy. Continuous care of Wilson patients (38, 10 of among them without hepatic or neurological signs) in a specialised outpatients clinic since 1964 has proven worth. 31 patients consistently treated with D-Penicillamin tolerated the drug well with few side effects. Even marked neurological symptoms improved, some patients became virtually free of symptoms. All patients without clinical signs remained free of symptoms. If intolerance to D-Penicillamin occurs, Trientine and zinc are an effective alternative therapy. Recurrent hepatic decompensations were observed in 2 female patients. One of them eventually required a liver transplant. 19 pregnancies could be carried to full term without complications or fetal damage while taking medication (17 with D-Penicillamin, 2 with Trientine and zinc). Discontinuation of therapy resulted in fatal hepatic failure in one pregnant patient.

AB  - Purpose - Wilson's disease is characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms with frequent extrapyramidal and intellectual presentations. They have an insidious evolution that leads to a late diagnosis and less therapeutic effectiveness in the advanced forms. Methods - We report 21 cases of Wilson's disease with neurological complications, emphasizing clinical semiology, diagnostic means and problems of the therapeutics in our country. Results - The average age at the beginning of the disease was 17.6 years, with a female prevalence (8/13). The signs at first were mostly all neurological (71,4 %), then psychiatric (19 %) or hepatic (19 %). The most common neurological signs were dystonia of members (81 %), dysarthria (76 %), tremors (76 %) or disorders of motoricity (71,4 %). Sometimes there were sialorrhea or disorders of the handwriting. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 19 patients. Eighteen patients had clinical and/or biological hepatic involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical examinations, which found a low rate of copper in blood, a sinking rate of ceruloplasmin and a very high rate of urinary copper. The cerebral computer tomography shows a cortical and/or subcortical atrophy (37 %), and/or a low density of the central grey cores (35 %). The treatment was based on D-penicillamine and/or zinc sulfate, according to the availability of the drugs. The evolution was favourable among 18 patients (85 %) and not good in 42,8 % of the cases. Six of the first patients had poor evolution after many years of follow-up. Finally, only 12 patients (57 %) had a very good outcome. The family investigation made among 17 patients revealed 13 family cases. The only predictive factor of a poor evolution was the therapeutic noncompliance (P = 0.006). Conclusions - The neurological presentations are traditional during the Wilson's disease, but are often ignored. We must suspect the disease in children when faced with disorders of handwriting or school failures and in the adult, when faced with neurological symptoms in a patient having a hepatic disease. We must not hesitate to consider it even given purely psychiatric signs, and we had better know to seek the neurological ones. Â© 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Wilson's disease is characterized by a disorder of copper metabolism and the mechanism responsible for the basic defect still unknown. It's transmitted by autosomal recesisve inheritance in relation to chromosome 13. The presenting signs depend on the age of the patient. In children aged 4 to 10 years, it ranges from asyntomatic forms with minimal laboratory evidence to acute liver failure and death. The course of Wilson's disease is variable, but it normally becomes chronic, occasionally associatted with neurological, renal, haematological and ocular abnormalities. The diagnosis is based on serun and urinary cooper levels, serum cerulopasmin concentration and the histological study of the tissues in which the metal is deposited (liver, kidneys, CNS, etc.). Copper chelating agents (penicillamine, trientene, zinc sulphate) can be administered as a bridge to liver transplantation, which is the definitive treatment for this metabolic disorder. We present a retrospective study of 7 cases of Wilson's disease diagnosed in our center, focusing on the presenting signs, biochemical abnormalities, diagnostic methods, clinical course and treatment.

AB  - Delayed response to medical treatment sometimes leads to unnecessary liver transplantation in patients with severely decompensated Wilson disease. We report the course of five patients (mean age 13.4 years, range 11 to 15 years) with severely decompensated Wilson disease who were successfully treated medically. Prothrombin time improved after a minimum of 1 month and returned to normal within 3 months to 1 year or more.

AB  - We studied the relationship of regional cerebral glucose consumption (rCMRGlc) and striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding as assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) with the structural abnormalities of the brain in magnetic resonance images (MR), and the degree of neurological impairment in 18 patients with Wilson's disease (WD). The rCMRGlc was determined in the, basal ganglia, the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, and the cerebellar hemispheres. The severity of neurological signs, defined by semiquantitative motor impairment scores, correlated highly (r = -0.80) with the reduction of striatal rCMRGlc. Clinical. scores, striatal rCMRGlc, and the degree of MRI abnormalities showed no correlation with different indices of dopamine D2 receptor binding. Sequential PET measurements in three patients during treatment with chelating agents revealed a moderate increase of striatal rCMRGlc (in two patients) and a moderate to marked increase of striatal D2 receptor binding (in three patients) in association with clinical improvement. Our data suggest that the rCMRGlc represents a sensitive and objective measure for assessing and monitoring striatal and extrastriatal involvement in WD. The lack of correlation between the dopamine D2 receptor binding and striatal rCMRGlc and structural abnormalities may be explained by the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and different responses to treatment in WD patients.

AB  - Diagnosis, long-term management and family investigation of Wilson's disease are provided by selected clinical institutions in the GDR. From 187 patients detected since 1949, 111 are alive. In spite of the principal effectiveness of penicillamine treatment, confirmed by the disappearance of most of the central nervous system symptoms and successful professional rehabilitation of many patients, insufficient therapeutic discipline, psychosocial disturbances and penicillamine side-effects forcing its substitution by zinc or triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride in 14 cases need our further attention.

AB  - After initial promotion of copper excretion with D-penicillamine, the effect of oral zinc sulphate (3 x 150 mg/day, loading dose; 3 x 100 mg/day, maintenance dose) in two children with clinically stable Wilson's disease was evaluated after completion of three years' treatment. The course, judged by clinical, biochemical, and histological parameters was satisfactory in both. The urinary copper concentration reverted to less than 1.26 mumol/24 hours; and the serum copper concentration decreased further during zinc sulphate treatment. In one child the rise in 24 hour urinary copper excretion observed after a challenge dose of D-penicillamine (+/- 20 mg/kg) remained constant throughout the period of observation while the liver copper content fell from 1460 mug/g dry weight to 890 mug/g dry weight. In the other patient, however, the liver copper content as well as the 24 hour urinary copper excretion increased after D-penicillamine challenge during the third year of treatment. We conclude that zinc sulphate is a low toxic and well tolerated alternative for D-penicillamine. The dosage depends, however, on individual factors not yet well understood, and we recommend restriction of its use to patients who do not tolerate D-penicillamine well. We suggest monitoring of treatment with yearly D-penicillamine challenge and a liver biopsy if liver function deteriorates.

AB  - DESIGNA randomized, double-blind, controlled, 2-arm study of 48 patients with the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease. Patients either received 500 mg of trientine hydrochloride 2 times per day or 20 mg of tetrathiomolybdate 3 times per day with meals and 20 mg 3 times per day between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received 50 mg of zinc 2 times per day. Patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with neurologic and speech function assessed weekly; discharged taking 50 mg of zinc 3 times per day, and returned annually for follow-up.SETTINGA university hospital referral setting.PATIENTSPrimarily newly diagnosed patients with Wilson disease presenting with neurologic symptoms who had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with an anticopper drug.INTERVENTIONTreatment with either trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESNeurologic function was assessed by semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations. Drug adverse events were evaluated by blood cell counts and biochemical measures.RESULTSSix of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm underwent neurologic deterioration (P<.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had adverse effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had further transaminase elevations. One patient receiving trientine had an adverse effect of anemia. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration. Neurologic and speech recovery during a 3-year follow-up period were quite good.CONCLUSIONTetrathiomolybdate is a better choice than trientine for preserving neurologic function in patients who present with neurologic disease.OBJECTIVETo compare tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in treating patients with the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease for the frequency of neurologic worsening, adverse effects, and degree of neurologic recovery.

AB  - Although administration of zinc to human subjects has been reported to interfere with lymphocyte function, this single report has never been confirmed or refuted. We have developed zinc as a lifelong therapy for patients with Wilson's disease. Interference with lymphocyte function occurring as a side effect of zinc therapy could produce serious problems in our patients. We evaluated lymphocyte mitogenic response and natural killer cell activity in patients with Wilson's disease treated for 5 years or longer with zinc, in comparison with normal controls, and found no differences. In a second study, we evaluated these same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after 1 year of zinc therapy, and again found no significant differences. We have seen no indications of immune suppression or increased susceptibility to infections in our patients, who have now been treated with zinc for up to 15 years. We conclude that any side effects from compromised lymphocyte function caused by administration of zinc are not of concern to patients with Wilson's disease.

AB  - Background: The initial treatment of the neurologic presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, used for years on most patients, causes neurologic worsening in up to half of such patients, and half of those who worsen never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We have developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for this type of patient, and it has worked well in open label studies. Trientine, another anticopper drug on the market approved for penicillamine intolerant patients, had not been tried in this type of patient. Here, we report on a double blind trial of TM versus trientine in the neurologically presenting Wilson's disease patient. Design and Methods: The study was a double blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc, or trientine plus zinc, for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they presented with neurologic symptoms from Wilson's disease, if they had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed in the hospital for the 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations, to evaluate possible neurologic worsening. They also had blood and urine studies done weekly. At discharge from hospital they were continued on zinc maintenance therapy, and returned at yearly intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients were entered into the trientine arm and 6 reached criteria for neurologic deterioration, while 25 patients were entered into the TM arm and only 1 deteriorated (p < 0.05). One patient on trientine had an adverse event while 7 on TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurologic and speech recovery over 3 years was good. Interpretation: TM is a superior choice to trientine for the initial therapy of neurologic Wilson's disease. Â© 2008 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - AIM:To compare the long-term effect of succimer (Suc) with that of penicillamine (Pen) in treating hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD).METHODS:One hundred and twenty patients with HLD were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n =60) received Suc 750mg,po.bid.Group B (n =60) received Pen 250mg, po. qid. The period of maintenance treatment varied from 6 months to 3 years, averaging 1.5 years. Symptoms and therapeutic effects were evaluated by modified Goldstein scale.RESULTS:The total effectiveness of group A in two different periods of treatment were 80% and 85% respectively, higher than those of group B (58% and 59% respectively)(P < 0.05). Suc also had obvious curative effects for the patients who failed in the use of Pen. There were fewer side effect in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). Suc and Pen could increase urinary copper excretion effectively and continually.CONCLUSION:Suc is more effective and safer than Pen. Clinically, it can replace Pen as first-choice drug for long-term maintenance therapy of HLD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Wilson&rsquo;s disease is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism, leading to the accumulation of copper in the liver as well as the brain, cornea and other organs. Here, we describe the adult cases of hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease diagnosed at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the University Hospital Lausanne, Switzerland between September 2004 and August 2016. METHOD(S): Clinical manifestations, results of diagnostic tests, management and outcomes of adult patients with hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease were assessed based on standardised medical records. In addition, liver histology was reviewed and the lesional patterns were recorded. RESULT(S): Ten new adult cases of hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease were diagnosed in our centre between September 2004 and August 2016. Male to female ratio was 1:1 and median age at diagnosis was 26 (range 18&ndash;56) years. Four patients presented with acute liver failure, four with persistently elevated liver function tests, and two with decompensated cirrhosis; none had neurological manifestations. Only one patient had a Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring. Median ceruloplasmin level at diagnosis was 0.13 (range <0.03&ndash;0.30) g/l, median 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 2.8 (range 0.3&ndash;77.3) &mu;mol, and median hepatic copper concentration was 789 (range 284&ndash;1677) &mu;g/g. At least one mutation in the ATP7B gene was identified in eight patients. Allelic frequency of the common H1069Q mutation was 19%. Leipzig score was &ge;5 in all patients. Three patients presenting with acute liver failure and the two with decompensated cirrhosis underwent successful liver transplantation. One patient with acute liver failure recovered under chelation therapy, as predicted by a Dhawan score <11. D-penicillamine was used as first-line chelator treatment, with a subsequent switch to trientine due to adverse effects in three out of six patients. CONCLUSION(S): The clinical presentation of hepatic Wilson&rsquo;s disease is highly variable. Three out of 10 patients were diagnosed at an age >35 years. A high index of suspicion in clinically compatible situations is key.

AB  - Background and aims: Only a few epidemiological studies on the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) have been performed to date, and the results vary widely according to the reports. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, ambulatory care and treatments of patients with WD in France. Method(s): Among the 58 million general health scheme beneficiaries (86% of the French population), people managed for WD in 2013 were identified using hospitalisation diagnosis in 2011-2013 or specific long-term disease status with a 100% reimbursement for specific healthcare in 2013. Data were derived from the Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). Prevalence by age and sex were calculated. Result(s): In 2013, 906 prevalent cases were identified, yielding a crude prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 in males and 1.44 per 100,000 in females. This prevalence is comparable to that reported in other population-based studies in European countries and to a study using a similar method. Almost 40% of patients were treated by D-penicillamine and 14.3% were treated by zinc acetate. Trientine, delivered on a compassionate basis, was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients underwent liver transplantation and 4% had already undergone liver transplantation in previous years. Fifteen per cent of patients received antidepressants, a higher rate than in general population. Conclusion(s): This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population based on administrative data and constitutes an important step to understand the impact of WD and to study quality of care.

AB  - Background/Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, the preference of medication, and the potential outcome of Wilson disease in Taiwan. We aimed to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson disease based on the data generated from this study. Methods: We utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records of nearly 99% of Taiwan's residents. The database used is a random sample of two-million out of 23-million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two-million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in either outpatient clinic or inpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was mostly established at 20-24 and 10-14 years of age, followed by 25-29 years. Fifty four of all subjects (81.8%) started the treatment with D-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. Conclusion: D-penicillamine is still the most popular prescription of Wilson disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a favorable potential outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study. Copyright Â© 2017

AB  - Objective: Urinary copper excretion rates and non-caeruloplasmin associated copper concentrations are increased in patients with Wilson disease. However, there is little literature describing the monitoring of these parameters over the long term. Methods: This is a monocentric retrospective study including data collected between 2003 and 2015 from 321 patients with Wilson disease by chart review. The patients were under therapy with D-penicillamine, trientine, or zinc. 24-h urinary copper excretion rates, non-caeruloplasmin associated copper, and total serum copper concentrations were determined at the start of therapy, as well as 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and >= 60 months after the start of therapy. For patients taking chelating agents, all parameters were measured while under continued therapy, as well as after a 48-h dose interruption. A mathematical formula to predict 24-h urinary copper excretion rates under different therapies was established. Results: In all treatment groups, urinary copper excretion rates decreased over time, but the inter-individual variation of the results was high. Non-caeruloplasmin associated copper concentrations tended to decline over time, but with a higher variation of results than that observed for urinary copper excretion rates. Conclusion: Due to their variability, urinary copper excretion rates and serum copper concentrations are less than ideal parameters by which to monitor the benefit of a copper-reducing therapy. Urinary copper excretion rates seem to be more suitable than non-caeruloplasmin associated copper concentrations for this purpose. Copyright Â© 2018 SSIEM

AB  - Background: Experience with zinc in treating symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. Aim: To study the efficacy of Penicillamine followed by zinc in treating symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed case records of 31 symptomatic hepatic WD patients for whom disease severity scores (Child's, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), Nazer's, and New Wilson Index (NWI) score) and 24-h urinary copper were compared at 3-time points-baseline at presentation, at transition from penicillamine to zinc and at end of follow up. Results: Thirty-one patients (median age 11 [5-24] years) with symptomatic hepatic WD were studied; ten had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was changed to zinc sulfate either due to financial constraints (28 patients) or due to adverse effects of penicillamine (3 patients). At presentation (baseline), six patients belonged to Child's class A, five to Child's B, and 17 to Child's C. Duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, and of subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Child's, MELD, Nazer's, and NWI score) at the transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement was maintained until the end of study period with 90% survival at 10 (2-20) years. Fifteen of the 17 Child's C cirrhotic patients showed significant improvement in disease severity scores from baseline until end of follow up. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in resource-constrained setting for symptomatic hepatic WD patients in all grades of baseline disease severity. Some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to WD may be managed with medical treatment, avoiding liver transplantation. Copyright Â© 2018, Indian Society of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Introduction: Aim of the study was to characterize the clinical spectrum of long-term treated patients with Wilson's disease (WD) and to identify risk factors influencing long-term outcome. Methods: In a cross-sectional study 30 WD-patients being treated for at least 2.5 and up to 31 years underwent a detailed clinical investigation, scoring of clinical findings yielding 7 motor and 3 non-motor subscores as well as laboratory testing. A factor analysis of these subscores and laboratory parameters was performed to detect those items with the highest influence on outcome, an ANOVA and subgroup analysis tested the influence of age, age at onset of diagnosis and duration of treatment on outcome. A correlation analysis was performed between clinical subscores and laboratory findings. Results: Three factors (F1-F3) characterized the clinical outcome (F1: tremor and pathological reflexes; F2: dystonia and dysarthria; F3: cerebellar abnormalities and gait), and three factors the laboratory findings (LF1: serum level of ceruloplasmin; LF2: liver enzymes; LF3: INR). Mildly affected patients had an elevated 24 h urinary copper excretion, more affected patients presented with elevated liver enzymes. Six of the 7 motor subscores did not change with duration of treatment, whereas tremor (p <.04), the total score (p <.02) and especially the non-motor items (p <.001) significantly increased with duration of treatment. The outcome of patients with neuropsychiatric abnormalities was significantly worse (p <.01) compared to the rest of the patients. Conclusions: Long-term outcome in WD is influenced by patient's compliance and neurological comorbidity. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To investigate the effect and safety of Gandouling plus low-dose D-penicillamine for treating patients with Wilson's disease (WD) who have neurological symptoms. WD patients with neurological symptoms were divided into two groups: a treatment group (n=53) and a control group (n=50). The treatment group received anti-copper therapy with a combination of Gandouling and low-dose D-penicillamine (10 mg/kg), whereas the control group was with conventional dose D-penicillamine (20 mg/kg) monotherapy. The clinical efficacies, adverse reactions, and results of the various hematological and biochemical investigations were recorded and analyzed statistically. Overall, 98.11% of the WD patients treated with the combined therapy experienced alleviation of their neurological condition (paralleled by a significantly improved Global Assessment Scale score or remained stable). Their white blood cell and platelet counts stabilized, and their liver function was improved or remained stable. The combined therapy also obviously promoted improved 24-h urinary copper excretion. Only 15.09% of the WD patients with the combined therapy experienced adverse reactions, including neurological deterioration in one case (1.89%) and hepatic worsening in one case (1.89%), which was less frequent than that in the control group given conventional-dose D-penicillamine monotherapy. Treating WD patients with neurological symptoms using Gandouling plus low-dose D-penicillamine is effective and safe. Copyright Â© 2018 JTCM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Wilsonian Fulminant Hepatic Failure (WFHF) is a serious condition, typically requiring liver transplantation (LT). As a result of its relative rarity, WFHF has been diffcult to study in depth. Data in pediatric populations (<18 years of age) are scarce and limited to case reports and small case series. The aims of this systematic review were to examine the clinical and biochemical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of children and adolescents with WFHF. Methods: Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was restricted to papers published in English, between January-1984 and March 01<sup>st</sup>, 2017. Papers were excluded if pediatric data were not extractable. Wilson disease (WD) was defned as per AASLD guidelines. Due to the heterogeneity of the defnition of acute liver failure (ALF) in the literature, subjects were included if they were defned as having ALF by the paper's authors. The following data points were extracted from articles: study design, initial clinical and biochemical characteristics, genetic mutations, treatment and clinical outcome. If not reported, the following ratios were calculated: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to total bilirubin (TBIL) < 2 and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 4. Results: A total of 56 (case reports (30), case-series (23) and cohort studies (3)) manuscripts involving 274 participants met the study inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in Asia (21) followed by 19 in North America, 15 in Europe, and 1 in Australia. Studies ranged in size from 1-61 subjects with a median age of 12.9 years at presentation (range 4.0-17.6 years). Females represented 74% (202/274) of all patients. Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen in 80% (153/191) and Coombs negative hemolytic anemia was reported in 98% (61/62). ALP/TBIL and AST/ALT ratios were evaluated in 60 (22%) and 63 (23%) of participants, respectively and were found to be < 2 and > 4 in less than 55% of subjects. 47% (128/274) of reported subjects underwent LT. Of these 58% (74/128) underwent deceased-donor LT, and 20% (25/128) received a live-donor LT. Graft type was not reported in the remaining subjects. 24% (65/274) of reported cases achieved spontaneous liver recovery with the assistance of extracorporeal liver support systems. Plasmapheresis was the most commonly used extracorporeal system and D-penicillamine was the most commonly used chelating agent in subjects who survived with their native liver. ATP7B mutations were only reported in 21 participants, thus limiting assessment of genotype-phenotype relationships. Conclusion: This is the frst systematic review examining WFHF in a substantial cohort of children and adolescents. The female preponderance of WFHF is clearly demonstrated in this analysis. Of note, only half of reported subjects required LT with the remaining responding to medical therapy. This fnding may be driven by biased reporting of cases describing the use of liver support systems. It may also refect subtle variations in WFHF disease defnition. Prospective studies are required to explore the true frequency and necessity of LT in WFHF.
